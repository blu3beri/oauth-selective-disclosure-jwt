1.  Introduction

   This document specifies conventions for creating JSON Web Signature
   (JWS) [RFC7515] structures with JSON [RFC8259] objects as the payload
   while supporting selective disclosure of individual elements of that
   JSON.  Because JSON Web Token (JWT) [RFC7519] is a very prevalent
   application of JWS with a JSON payload, the selective disclosure of
   JWT claims receives primary treatment herein.  However, that does not
   preclude the mechanism's applicability to other or more general
   applications of JWS with JSON payloads.

   The JSON-based representation of claims in a signed JWT is secured
   against modification using JWS digital signatures.  A consumer of a
   signed JWT that has checked the signature can safely assume that the
   contents of the token have not been modified.  However, anyone
   receiving an unencrypted JWT can read all the claims.  Likewise,
   anyone with the decryption key receiving encrypted JWT can also read
   all the claims.

   One of the common use cases of a signed JWT is representing a user's
   identity.  As long as the signed JWT is one-time use, it typically
   only contains those claims the user has consented to disclose to a
   specific Verifier.  However, there is an increasing number of use
   cases where a signed JWT is created once and then used a number of
   times by the user (the "Holder" of the JWT).  In such use cases, the
   signed JWT needs to contain the superset of all claims the user of
   the signed JWT might want to disclose to Verifiers at some point.
   The ability to selectively disclose a subset of these claims
   depending on the Verifier becomes crucial to ensure minimum
   disclosure and prevent Verifiers from obtaining claims irrelevant for
   the transaction at hand.  SD-JWTs defined in this document enable
   such selective disclosure of JWT claims.

   One example of a multi-use JWT is a verifiable credential, an Issuer-
   signed credential that contains the claims about a subject, and whose
   authenticity can be cryptographically verified.

   Similar to the JWT specification on which it builds, this document is
   a product of the Web Authorization Protocol (oauth) working group.
   However, while both JWT and SD-JWT have potential OAuth 2.0
   applications, their utility and application is certainly not
   constrained to OAuth 2.0.  JWT was developed as a general-purpose
   token format and has seen widespread usage in a variety of
   applications.  SD-JWT is a selective disclosure mechanism for JWT and
   is similarly intended to be general-purpose specification.

   While JWTs with claims describing natural persons are a common use
   case, the mechanisms defined in this document can be used for other
   use cases as well.

   In an SD-JWT, claims can be hidden, but cryptographically protected
   against undetected modification.  "Claims" here refers to both object
   properties (key-value pairs) as well as array elements.  When issuing
   the SD-JWT to the Holder, the Issuer includes the cleartext
   counterparts of all hidden claims, the so-called Disclosures, outside
   the signed part of the SD-JWT.

   The Holder decides which claims to disclose to a particular Verifier
   and includes the respective Disclosures in the SD-JWT to that
   Verifier.  The Verifier has to verify that all disclosed claim values
   were part of the original Issuer-signed JWT.  The Verifier will not,
   however, learn any claim values not disclosed in the Disclosures.

   This document also specifies an optional mechanism for Key Binding,
   which is the concept of binding an SD-JWT to a Holder's public key
   and requiring that the Holder prove possession of the corresponding
   private key when presenting the SD-JWT.  The strength of the binding
   is conditional upon the trust in the protection of the private key of
   the key pair an SD-JWT is bound to.

   SD-JWT can be used with any JSON-based representation of claims,
   including JSON-LD.

   This specification aims to be easy to implement and to leverage
   established and widely used data formats and cryptographic algorithms
   wherever possible.

1.1.  Feature Summary

   *  This specification defines

      -  a format for the payload of an Issuer-signed JWT containing
         selectively disclosable claims that include object properties
         (key-value pairs), array elements, and nested data structures
         built from these,

      -  a format for data associated with the JWT that enables
         selectively disclosing those claims,

      -  facilities for binding the JWT to a key and associated data to
         prove possession thereof, and

      -  a format, extending the JWS Compact Serialization, for the
         combined transport of the JWT and associated data that is
         suitable for both issuance and presentation.

   *  An alternate format utilizing the JWS JSON Serialization is also
      specified.

   *  This specification enables combining selectively disclosable
      claims with clear-text claims that are always disclosed.

   *  For selectively disclosable claims that are object properties,
      both the key and value are always blinded.

1.2.  Conventions and Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP
   14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

   *base64url* denotes the URL-safe base64 encoding without padding
   defined in Section 2 of [RFC7515].

2.  Terms and Definitions

   Selective disclosure:  Process of a Holder disclosing to a Verifier a
      subset of claims contained in a claim set issued by an Issuer.

   Selectively Disclosable JWT (SD-JWT):  A composite structure,
      consisting of an Issuer-signed JWT (JWS, [RFC7515]), Disclosures,
      and optionally a Key Binding JWT that supports selective
      disclosure as defined in this document.  It can contain both
      regular claims and digests of selectively-disclosable claims.

   Disclosure:  A combination of a salt, a cleartext claim name (present
      when the claim is a key-value pair and absent when the claim is an
      array element), and a cleartext claim value, all of which are used
      to calculate a digest for the respective claim.

   Key Binding:  Ability of the Holder to prove legitimate possession of
      an SD-JWT by proving control over the same private key during the
      issuance and presentation.  An SD-JWT with Key Binding contains a
      public key, or a reference to a public key, that matches to the
      private key controlled by the Holder.

   Issuer:  An entity that creates SD-JWTs.

   Holder:  An entity that received SD-JWTs from the Issuer and has
      control over them.

   Verifier:  An entity that requests, checks, and extracts the claims
      from an SD-JWT with its respective Disclosures.

4.  Concepts

   This section describes SD-JWTs with their respective Disclosures and
   Key Binding at a conceptual level, abstracting from the data formats
   described in Section 5.

4.1.  SD-JWT and Disclosures

   An SD-JWT, at its core, is a digitally signed JSON document
   containing digests over the selectively disclosable claims with the
   Disclosures outside the document.  Disclosures can be omitted without
   breaking the signature, and modifying them can be detected.
   Selectively disclosable claims can be individual object properties
   (key-value pairs) or array elements.

   Each digest value ensures the integrity of, and maps to, the
   respective Disclosure.  Digest values are calculated using a hash
   function over the Disclosures, each of which contains a random salt,
   the claim name (only when the claim is an object property), and the
   claim value.  The Disclosures are sent to the Holder as part of the
   SD-JWT in the format defined in Section 5.11.

   An SD-JWT MAY also contain clear-text claims that are always
   disclosed to the Verifier.

4.2.  Disclosing to a Verifier

   To disclose to a Verifier a subset of the SD-JWT claim values, a
   Holder sends only the Disclosures of those selectively released
   claims to the Verifier as part of the SD-JWT.

4.3.  Optional Key Binding

   Key Binding is an optional feature.  When Key Binding is required by
   the use-case, the SD-JWT MUST contain information about the key
   material controlled by the Holder.

   Note: How the public key is included in SD-JWT is out of scope of
   this document.  It can be passed by value or by reference.

   The Holder can then create a signed document, the Key Binding JWT as
   defined in Section 5.10, using its private key.  This document
   contains some data provided by the Verifier such as a nonce to ensure
   the freshness of the signature, and audience to indicate the intended
   audience for the document.

   The Key Binding JWT can be included as part of the SD-JWT and sent to
   the Verifier as described in Section 5.11.

   Note that there may be other ways to send a Key Binding JWT to the
   Verifier or for the Holder to prove possession of the key material
   included in an SD-JWT.  In these cases, inclusion of the Key Binding
   JWT in the SD-JWT is not required.

4.4.  Verification

   At a high level, the Verifier

   *  receives the SD-JWT from the Holder and verifies its signature
      using the Issuer's public key,

   *  verifies the Key Binding JWT, if Key Binding is required by the
      Verifier's policy, using the public key included in the SD-JWT,

   *  calculates the digests over the Holder-Selected Disclosures and
      verifies that each digest is contained in the SD-JWT.

   The detailed algorithm is described in Section 6.3.

5.  Data Formats

   This section defines data formats for SD-JWT including the Issuer-
   signed JWT content, Disclosures, and Key Binding JWT.

5.1.  SD-JWT Payload

   An SD-JWT has a JWT component that MUST be signed using the Issuer's
   private key.  It MUST use a JWS asymmetric digital signature
   algorithm.  It MUST NOT use none or an identifier for a symmetric
   algorithm (MAC).

   The payload of an SD-JWT is a JSON object according to the following
   rules:

   1.  The payload MAY contain the _sd_alg key described in Section 5.8.

   2.  The payload MAY contain one or more digests of Disclosures to
       enable selective disclosure of the respective claims, created and
       formatted as described below.

   3.  The payload MAY contain one or more decoy digests to obscure the
       actual number of claims in the SD-JWT, created and formatted as
       described in Section 5.6.

   4.  The payload MAY contain one or more non-selectively disclosable
       claims.

   5.  The payload MAY also contain a Holder's public key or a reference
       thereto, as well as further claims such as iss, iat, etc. as
       defined or required by the application using SD-JWTs.

   6.  The payload MUST NOT contain the reserved claims _sd or ...
       except for the purpose of transporting digests as described
       below.

   7.  The same digest value MUST NOT appear more than once in the SD-
       JWT.

   Applications of SD-JWT SHOULD be explicitly typed using the typ
   header parameter.  See Section 9.10 for more details.

   It is the Issuer who decides which claims are selectively disclosable
   and which are not.  However, claims controlling the validity of the
   SD-JWT, such as iss, exp, or nbf are usually included in plaintext.
   End-User claims MAY be included as plaintext as well, e.g., if hiding
   the particular claims from the Verifier is not required in the
   intended use case.

   Claims that are not selectively disclosable are included in the SD-
   JWT in plaintext just as they would be in any other JSON structure.

5.2.  Creating Disclosures

   Disclosures are created differently depending on whether a claim is
   an object property (key-value pair) or an array element.

   *  For a claim that is an object property, the Issuer creates a
      Disclosure as described in Section 5.2.1.

   *  For a claim that is an array element, the Issuer creates a
      Disclosure as described in Section 5.2.2.

5.2.1.  Disclosures for Object Properties

   For each claim that is an object property and that is to be made
   selectively disclosable, the Issuer MUST create a Disclosure as
   follows:

   *  Create an array of three elements in this order:

      1.  A salt value.  MUST be a string.  See Section 9.3 and
          Section 9.4 for security considerations.  It is RECOMMENDED to
          base64url-encode minimum 128 bits of cryptographically secure
          pseudorandom data, producing a string.  The salt value MUST be
          unique for each claim that is to be selectively disclosed.
          The Issuer MUST NOT disclose the salt value to any party other
          than the Holder.

      2.  The claim name, or key, as it would be used in a regular JWT
          body.  The value MUST be a string.

      3.  The claim value, as it would be used in a regular JWT body.
          The value MAY be of any type that is allowed in JSON,
          including numbers, strings, booleans, arrays, and objects.

   *  JSON-encode the array, producing an UTF-8 string.

   *  base64url-encode the byte representation of the UTF-8 string,
      producing a US-ASCII [RFC0020] string.  This string is the
      Disclosure.

   The order is decided based on the readability considerations: salts
   would have a constant length within the SD-JWT, claim names would be
   around the same length all the time, and claim values would vary in
   size, potentially being large objects.

   The following example illustrates the steps described above.

   The array is created as follows:

   ["_26bc4LT-ac6q2KI6cBW5es", "family_name", "Möbius"]

   The resulting Disclosure would be: WyJfMjZiYzRMVC1hYzZxMktJNmNCVzVlcy
   IsICJmYW1pbHlfbmFtZSIsICJNw7ZiaXVzIl0

   Note that variations in whitespace, encoding of Unicode characters,
   ordering of object properties, etc., are allowed in the JSON
   representation and no canonicalization needs be performed before
   base64url-encoding.  For example, the following strings are all valid
   and encode the same claim value "Möbius":

   *  A different way to encode the unicode umlaut:
      WyJfMjZiYzRMVC1hYzZxMktJNmNCVzVlcyIsICJmYW1pbHlfbmFtZSIsICJNX
      HUwMGY2Yml1cyJd

   *  No white space:
      WyJfMjZiYzRMVC1hYzZxMktJNmNCVzVlcyIsImZhbWlseV9uYW1lIiwiTcO2Y
      ml1cyJd

   *  Newline characters between elements:
      WwoiXzI2YmM0TFQtYWM2cTJLSTZjQlc1ZXMiLAoiZmFtaWx5X25hbWUiLAoiT
      cO2Yml1cyIKXQ

   See Appendix B for some further considerations on the Disclosure
   format approach.

5.2.2.  Disclosures for Array Elements

   For each claim that is an array element and that is to be made
   selectively disclosable, the Issuer MUST create a Disclosure as
   follows:

   *  The array MUST contain two elements in this order:

      1.  The salt value as described in Section 5.2.1.

      2.  The array element that is to be hidden.  This value MAY be of
          any type that is allowed in JSON, including numbers, strings,
          booleans, arrays, and objects.

   The Disclosure string is created by JSON-encoding this array and
   base64url-encoding the byte representation of the resulting string as
   described in Section 5.2.1.  The same considerations regarding
   variations in the result of the JSON encoding apply.

   For example, a Disclosure for the second element of the nationalities
   array in the following claim set:

   {
     "nationalities": ["DE", "FR"]
   }

   could be created by first creating the following array:

   ["lklxF5jMYlGTPUovMNIvCA", "FR"]

   The resulting Disclosure would be:
   WyJsa2x4RjVqTVlsR1RQVW92TU5JdkNBIiwgIkZSIl0

5.3.  Hashing Disclosures

   For embedding the Disclosures in the SD-JWT, the Disclosures are
   hashed using the hash algorithm specified in the _sd_alg claim
   described in Section 5.8.  The resulting digest is then included in
   the SD-JWT payload instead of the original claim value, as described
   next.

   The digest MUST be taken over the US-ASCII bytes of the base64url-
   encoded Disclosure.  This follows the convention in JWS [RFC7515] and
   JWE [RFC7516].  The bytes of the digest MUST then be base64url-
   encoded.

   It is important to note that:

   *  The input to the hash function MUST be the base64url-encoded
      Disclosure, not the bytes encoded by the base64url string.

   *  The bytes of the output of the hash function MUST be base64url-
      encoded, and are not the bytes making up the (often used) hex
      representation of the bytes of the digest.

   For example, the SHA-256 digest of the Disclosure
   WyI2cU1RdlJMNWhhaiIsICJmYW1pbHlfbmFtZSIsICJNw7ZiaXVzIl0 would be
   uutlBuYeMDyjLLTpf6Jxi7yNkEF35jdyWMn9U7b_RYY.

   The SHA-256 digest of the Disclosure
   WyJsa2x4RjVqTVlsR1RQVW92TU5JdkNBIiwgIkZSIl0 would be
   w0I8EKcdCtUPkGCNUrfwVp2xEgNjtoIDlOxc9-PlOhs.

5.4.  Embedding Disclosure Digests in SD-JWTs

   For selectively disclosable claims, the digests of the Disclosures
   are embedded into the SD-JWT instead of the claims themselves.  The
   precise way of embedding depends on whether a claim is an object
   property (key-value pair) or an array element.

   *  For a claim that is an object property, the Issuer embeds a
      Disclosure as described in Section 5.4.1.

   *  For a claim that is an array element, the Issuer creates a
      Disclosure as described in Section 5.4.2.

5.4.1.  Object Properties

   Digests of Disclosures for object properties are added to an array
   under the new key _sd in the object.  The _sd key MUST refer to an
   array of strings, each string being a digest of a Disclosure or a
   decoy digest as described in Section 5.6.

   The array MAY be empty in case the Issuer decided not to selectively
   disclose any of the claims at that level.  However, it is RECOMMENDED
   to omit the _sd key in this case to save space.

   The Issuer MUST hide the original order of the claims in the array.
   To ensure this, it is RECOMMENDED to shuffle the array of hashes,
   e.g., by sorting it alphanumerically or randomly, after potentially
   adding decoy digests as described in Section 5.6.  The precise method
   does not matter as long as it does not depend on the original order
   of elements.

   For example, using the digest of the object property Disclosure
   created above, the Issuer could create the following SD-JWT payload
   to make family_name selectively disclosable:

   {
     "given_name": "Alice",
     "_sd": ["uutlBuYeMDyjLLTpf6Jxi7yNkEF35jdyWMn9U7b_RYY"]
   }

5.4.2.  Array Elements

   Digests of Disclosures for array elements are added to the array in
   the same position as the original claim value in the array.  For each
   digest, an object of the form {"...": "<digest>"} is added to the
   array.  The key MUST always be the string ... (three dots).  The
   value MUST be the digest of the Disclosure created as described in
   Section 5.3.  There MUST NOT be any other keys in the object.

   For example, using the digest of the array element Disclosure created
   above, the Issuer could create the following SD-JWT payload to make
   the second element of the nationalities array selectively
   disclosable:

   {
     "nationalities":
       ["DE", {"...": "w0I8EKcdCtUPkGCNUrfwVp2xEgNjtoIDlOxc9-PlOhs"}]
   }

   As described in Section 6.3, Verifiers ignore all selectively
   disclosable array elements for which they did not receive a
   Disclosure.  In the example above, the verification process would
   output an array with only one element unless a matching Disclosure
   for the second element is received.

5.5.  Example 1: SD-JWT

   This example uses the following object as the set of claims that the
   Issuer is issuing:

   {
     "sub": "user_42",
     "given_name": "John",
     "family_name": "Doe",
     "email": "johndoe@example.com",
     "phone_number": "+1-202-555-0101",
     "phone_number_verified": true,
     "address": {
       "street_address": "123 Main St",
       "locality": "Anytown",
       "region": "Anystate",
       "country": "US"
     },
     "birthdate": "1940-01-01",
     "updated_at": 1570000000,
     "nationalities": [
       "US",
       "DE"
     ]
   }

   The following non-normative example shows a payload of an SD-JWT for
   this End-User data:

   {
     "_sd": [
       "CrQe7S5kqBAHt-nMYXgc6bdt2SH5aTY1sU_M-PgkjPI",
       "JzYjH4svliH0R3PyEMfeZu6Jt69u5qehZo7F7EPYlSE",
       "PorFbpKuVu6xymJagvkFsFXAbRoc2JGlAUA2BA4o7cI",
       "TGf4oLbgwd5JQaHyKVQZU9UdGE0w5rtDsrZzfUaomLo",
       "XQ_3kPKt1XyX7KANkqVR6yZ2Va5NrPIvPYbyMvRKBMM",
       "XzFrzwscM6Gn6CJDc6vVK8BkMnfG8vOSKfpPIZdAfdE",
       "gbOsI4Edq2x2Kw-w5wPEzakob9hV1cRD0ATN3oQL9JM",
       "jsu9yVulwQQlhFlM_3JlzMaSFzglhQG0DpfayQwLUK4"
     ],
     "iss": "https://example.com/issuer",
     "iat": 1683000000,
     "exp": 1883000000,
     "sub": "user_42",
     "nationalities": [
       {
         "...": "pFndjkZ_VCzmyTa6UjlZo3dh-ko8aIKQc9DlGzhaVYo"
       },
       {
         "...": "7Cf6JkPudry3lcbwHgeZ8khAv1U1OSlerP0VkBJrWZ0"
       }
     ],
     "_sd_alg": "sha-256",
     "cnf": {
       "jwk": {
         "kty": "EC",
         "crv": "P-256",
         "x": "TCAER19Zvu3OHF4j4W4vfSVoHIP1ILilDls7vCeGemc",
         "y": "ZxjiWWbZMQGHVWKVQ4hbSIirsVfuecCE6t4jT9F2HZQ"
       }
     }
   }

   The Issuer in this case made the following decisions:

   *  The nationalities array is always visible, but its contents are
      selectively disclosable.

   *  The sub element and essential verification data (iss, iat, cnf,
      etc.) are always visible.

   *  All other End-User claims are selectively disclosable.

   *  For address, the Issuer is using a flat structure, i.e., all of
      the claims in the address claim can only be disclosed in full.
      Other options are discussed in Section 5.7.

   The Issuer creates the following Disclosures:

   The payload is then signed by the Issuer to create a JWT like the
   following:

5.6.  Decoy Digests

   An Issuer MAY add additional digests to the SD-JWT payload that are
   not associated with any claim.  The purpose of such "decoy" digests
   is to make it more difficult for an attacker to see the original
   number of claims contained in the SD-JWT.  Decoy digests MAY be added
   both to the _sd array for objects as well as in arrays.

   It is RECOMMENDED to create the decoy digests by hashing over a
   cryptographically secure random number.  The bytes of the digest MUST
   then be base64url-encoded as above.  The same digest function as for
   the Disclosures MUST be used.

   For decoy digests, no Disclosure is sent to the Holder, i.e., the
   Holder will see digests that do not correspond to any Disclosure.
   See Section 10.3 for additional privacy considerations.

   To ensure readability and replicability, the examples in this
   specification do not contain decoy digests unless explicitly stated.
   For an example with decoy digests, see Appendix A.1.

5.7.  Nested Data in SD-JWTs

   Being JSON, an object in an SD-JWT payload MAY contain key-value
   pairs where the value is another object or objects MAY be elements in
   arrays.  In SD-JWT, the Issuer decides for each claim individually,
   on each level of the JSON, whether the claim should be selectively
   disclosable or not.  This choice can be made on each level
   independent from whether keys higher in the hierarchy are selectively
   disclosable.

   From this it follows that the _sd key containing digests MAY appear
   multiple times in an SD-JWT, and likewise, there MAY be multiple
   arrays within the hierarchy with each having selectively disclosable
   elements.  Digests of selectively disclosable claims MAY even appear
   within other Disclosures.

   The following examples illustrate some of the options an Issuer has.
   It is up to the Issuer to decide which option to use, depending on,
   for example, the expected use cases for the SD-JWT, requirements for
   privacy, size considerations, or ecosystem requirements.  For more
   examples with nested structures, see Appendix A.1 and Appendix A.2.

   The following input claim set is used as an example throughout this
   section:

   {
     "sub": "6c5c0a49-b589-431d-bae7-219122a9ec2c",
     "address": {
       "street_address": "Schulstr. 12",
       "locality": "Schulpforta",
       "region": "Sachsen-Anhalt",
       "country": "DE"
     }
   }

   Important: Throughout the examples in this document, line breaks had
   to be added to JSON strings and base64-encoded strings (as shown in
   the next example) to adhere to the 72 character limit for lines in
   RFCs and for readability.  JSON does not allow line breaks in
   strings.

5.7.1.  Option 1: Flat SD-JWT

   The Issuer can decide to treat the address claim as a block that can
   either be disclosed completely or not at all.  The following example
   shows that in this case, the entire address claim is treated as an
   object in the Disclosure.

   {
     "_sd": [
       "fOBUSQvo46yQO-wRwXBcGqvnbKIueISEL961_Sjd4do"
     ],
     "iss": "https://example.com/issuer",
     "iat": 1683000000,
     "exp": 1883000000,
     "sub": "6c5c0a49-b589-431d-bae7-219122a9ec2c",
     "_sd_alg": "sha-256"
   }

   The Issuer would create the following Disclosure:

   *Claim address*:

   *  SHA-256 Hash: fOBUSQvo46yQO-wRwXBcGqvnbKIueISEL961_Sjd4do

   *  Disclosure:
      WyIyR0xDNDJzS1F2ZUNmR2ZyeU5STjl3IiwgImFkZHJlc3MiLCB7InN0cmVl
      dF9hZGRyZXNzIjogIlNjaHVsc3RyLiAxMiIsICJsb2NhbGl0eSI6ICJTY2h1
      bHBmb3J0YSIsICJyZWdpb24iOiAiU2FjaHNlbi1BbmhhbHQiLCAiY291bnRy
      eSI6ICJERSJ9XQ

   *  Contents: ["2GLC42sKQveCfGfryNRN9w", "address", {"street_address":
      "Schulstr. 12", "locality": "Schulpforta", "region":
      "Sachsen-Anhalt", "country": "DE"}]

5.7.2.  Option 2: Structured SD-JWT

   The Issuer may instead decide to make the address claim contents
   selectively disclosable individually:

   {
     "iss": "https://example.com/issuer",
     "iat": 1683000000,
     "exp": 1883000000,
     "sub": "6c5c0a49-b589-431d-bae7-219122a9ec2c",
     "address": {
       "_sd": [
         "6vh9bq-zS4GKM_7GpggVbYzzu6oOGXrmNVGPHP75Ud0",
         "9gjVuXtdFROCgRrtNcGUXmF65rdezi_6Er_j76kmYyM",
         "KURDPh4ZC19-3tiz-Df39V8eidy1oV3a3H1Da2N0g88",
         "WN9r9dCBJ8HTCsS2jKASxTjEyW5m5x65_Z_2ro2jfXM"
       ]
     },
     "_sd_alg": "sha-256"
   }

   In this case, the Issuer would use the following data in the
   Disclosures for the address sub-claims:

   *Claim street_address*:

   *  SHA-256 Hash: 9gjVuXtdFROCgRrtNcGUXmF65rdezi_6Er_j76kmYyM

   *  Disclosure:
      WyIyR0xDNDJzS1F2ZUNmR2ZyeU5STjl3IiwgInN0cmVldF9hZGRyZXNzIiwg
      IlNjaHVsc3RyLiAxMiJd

   *  Contents: ["2GLC42sKQveCfGfryNRN9w", "street_address", "Schulstr.
      12"]

   *Claim locality*:

   *  Contents: ["6Ij7tM-a5iVPGboS5tmvVA", "region", "Sachsen-Anhalt"]

   *Claim country*:

   *  Disclosure:
      WyJlSThaV205UW5LUHBOUGVOZW5IZGhRIiwgImNvdW50cnkiLCAiREUiXQ

   *  Contents: ["eI8ZWm9QnKPpNPeNenHdhQ", "country", "DE"]

   The Issuer may also make one sub-claim of address non-selectively
   disclosable and hide only the other sub-claims:

   {
     "iss": "https://example.com/issuer",
     "iat": 1683000000,
     "exp": 1883000000,
     "sub": "6c5c0a49-b589-431d-bae7-219122a9ec2c",
     "address": {
       "_sd": [
         "6vh9bq-zS4GKM_7GpggVbYzzu6oOGXrmNVGPHP75Ud0",
         "9gjVuXtdFROCgRrtNcGUXmF65rdezi_6Er_j76kmYyM",
         "KURDPh4ZC19-3tiz-Df39V8eidy1oV3a3H1Da2N0g88"
       ],
       "country": "DE"
     },
     "_sd_alg": "sha-256"
   }

   There would be no Disclosure for country in this case.

5.7.3.  Option 3: SD-JWT with Recursive Disclosures

   The Issuer may also decide to make the address claim contents
   selectively disclosable recursively, i.e., the address claim is made
   selectively disclosable as well as its sub-claims:

   {
     "_sd": [
       "HvrKX6fPV0v9K_yCVFBiLFHsMaxcD_114Em6VT8x1lg"
     ],
     "iss": "https://example.com/issuer",
     "iat": 1683000000,
     "exp": 1883000000,
     "sub": "6c5c0a49-b589-431d-bae7-219122a9ec2c",
     "_sd_alg": "sha-256"
   }

   The Issuer creates Disclosures first for the sub-claims and then
   includes their digests in the Disclosure for the address claim:

   *Claim street_address*:

   *  SHA-256 Hash: 9gjVuXtdFROCgRrtNcGUXmF65rdezi_6Er_j76kmYyM

   *  Disclosure:
      WyIyR0xDNDJzS1F2ZUNmR2ZyeU5STjl3IiwgInN0cmVldF9hZGRyZXNzIiwg

5.8.  Hash Function Claim

   The claim _sd_alg indicates the hash algorithm used by the Issuer to
   generate the digests as described in Section 5.2.  When used, this
   claim MUST appear at the top level of the SD-JWT payload.  It MUST
   NOT be used in any object nested within the payload.  If the _sd_alg
   claim is not present at the top level, a default value of sha-256
   MUST be used.

   The hash algorithm identifier MUST be a hash algorithm value from the
   "Hash Name String" column in the IANA "Named Information Hash
   Algorithm" registry [IANA.Hash.Algorithms] or a value defined in
   another specification and/or profile of this specification.

   To promote interoperability, implementations MUST support the sha-256
   hash algorithm.

   See Section 9 for requirements regarding entropy of the salt, minimum
   length of the salt, and choice of a hash algorithm.

5.9.  Holder Public Key Claim

   If the Issuer wants to enable Key Binding, it includes a public key
   associated with the Holder, or a reference thereto.

   It is out of the scope of this document to describe how the Holder
   key pair is established.  For example, the Holder MAY provide a key
   pair to the Issuer, the Issuer MAY create the key pair for the
   Holder, or Holder and Issuer MAY use pre-established key material.

   Note: Examples in this document use the cnf Claim defined in
   [RFC7800] to include the raw public key by value in SD-JWT.

5.10.  Key Binding JWT

   This section defines the contents of the Key Binding JWT, which the
   Holder MAY include in the SD-JWT to prove the Key Binding to the
   Verifier.

   The JWT MUST contain the following elements:

   *  in the JOSE header,

      -  typ: REQUIRED.  MUST be kb+jwt, which explicitly types the Key
         Binding JWT as recommended in Section 3.11 of [RFC8725].

      -  alg: REQUIRED.  A digital signature algorithm identifier such
         as per IANA "JSON Web Signature and Encryption Algorithms"
         registry.  MUST NOT be none or an identifier for a symmetric
         algorithm (MAC).

   *  in the JWT body,

      -  iat: REQUIRED.  The value of this claim MUST be the time at
         which the Key Binding JWT was issued using the syntax defined
         in [RFC7519].

      -  aud: REQUIRED.  The intended receiver of the Key Binding JWT.
         How the value is represented is up to the protocol used and out
         of scope of this specification.

      -  nonce: REQUIRED.  Ensures the freshness of the signature.  The
         value type of this claim MUST be a string.  How this value is
         obtained is up to the protocol used and out of scope of this
         specification.

   To validate the signature on the Key Binding JWT, the Verifier MUST
   use the key material in the SD-JWT.  If it is not clear from the SD-
   JWT, the Key Binding JWT MUST specify which key material the Verifier
   needs to use to validate the Key Binding JWT signature using JOSE
   header parameters such as kid and x5c.

   Below is a non-normative example of a Key Binding JWT header:

   {
     "alg": "ES256",
     "typ": "kb+jwt"
   }

   Below is a non-normative example of a Key Binding JWT payload:

   {
     "nonce": "1234567890",
     "aud": "https://example.com/verifier",
     "iat": 1687450677
   }

   Below is a non-normative example of a Key Binding JWT produced by
   signing a payload in the example above:

   eyJhbGciOiAiRVMyNTYiLCAidHlwIjogImtiK2p3dCJ9.eyJub25jZSI6ICIxMjM0NTY
   3ODkwIiwgImF1ZCI6ICJodHRwczovL2V4YW1wbGUuY29tL3ZlcmlmaWVyIiwgImlhdCI
   6IDE2ODc0NTA2Nzd9.aO_-9gDiiBm1gXZx5TomGy4COPcjvL3U2qSiaZWFbjbt-Njtod
   YoE6zEHGxAg1c8WJuRKj4VIHjhIyI3psX9og

   Whether to require Key Binding is up to the Verifier's policy, based
   on the set of trust requirements such as trust frameworks it belongs
   to.

   Other ways of proving Key Binding MAY be used when supported by the
   Verifier, e.g., when the presented SD-JWT without a Key Binding JWT
   is itself embedded in a signed JWT.  See Section 7 for details.

5.11.  SD-JWT Structure

   An SD-JWT is composed of the following:

   *  the Issuer-signed JWT

   *  The Disclosures

   *  optionally a Key Binding JWT

   The serialized format for the SD-JWT is the concatenation of each
   part delineated with a single tilde ('~') character as follows:

<JWT>~<Disclosure 1>~<Disclosure 2>~...~<Disclosure N>~<optional KB-JWT>

   The order of the tilde separated values MUST be the Issuer-signed
   JWT, followed by any Disclosures, and lastly the optional Key Binding
   JWT.  In the case that there is no Key Binding JWT, the last element
   MUST be an empty string and the last separating tilde character MUST
   NOT be omitted.

   The Disclosures are linked to the SD-JWT payload through the digest
   values included therein.

   When issued to a Holder, the Issuer includes all the relevant
   Disclosures in the SD-JWT.

   For presentation to a Verifier, the Holder sends the SD-JWT including
   only its selected set of the Disclosures to the Verifier.

   The Holder MAY send any subset of the Disclosures to the Verifier,
   i.e., none, multiple, or all Disclosures.  For data that the Holder
   does not want to reveal to the Verifier, the Holder MUST NOT send
   Disclosures or reveal the salt values in any other way.

   A Holder MUST NOT send a Disclosure that was not included in the SD-
   JWT or send a Disclosure more than once.

   For Example 1 (#example-1), a non-normative example of an issued SD-
   JWT might look as follows (with Line breaks for formatting only):

6.  Verification and Processing

6.1.  Verification of the SD-JWT

   Upon receiving an SD-JWT, a Holder or a Verifier MUST ensure that

   *  the Issuer-signed JWT is valid, i.e., it is signed by the Issuer
      and the signature is valid, and

   *  all Disclosures are correct, i.e., their digests are referenced in
      the Issuer-signed JWT.

   The Holder or the Verifier MUST perform the following (or equivalent)
   steps when receiving an SD-JWT:

   1.  Separate the SD-JWT into the Issuer-signed JWT, the Disclosures
       (if any), and the Key Binding JWT (if present).

   2.  Validate the Issuer-signed JWT:

       1.  Ensure that a signing algorithm was used that was deemed
           secure for the application.  Refer to [RFC8725], Sections 3.1
           and 3.2 for details.  The none algorithm MUST NOT be
           accepted.

       2.  Validate the signature over the Issuer-signed JWT.

       3.  Validate the Issuer and that the signing key belongs to this
           Issuer.

       4.  Check that the Issuer-signed JWT is valid using nbf, iat, and
           exp claims, if provided in the SD-JWT, and not selectively
           disclosed.

       5.  Check that the _sd_alg claim value is understood and the hash
           algorithm is deemed secure.

   3.  Process the Disclosures and embedded digests in the issuser-
       signed JWT as follows:

       1.  For each Disclosure provided:

           1.  Calculate the digest over the base64url-encoded string as
               described in Section 5.3.

       2.  (*) Identify all embedded digests in the Issuer-signed JWT as
           follows:

           1.  Find all objects having an _sd key that refers to an
               array of strings.

           2.  Find all array elements that are objects with one key,
               that key being ... and referring to a string.

       3.  (**) For each embedded digest found in the previous step:

           1.  Compare the value with the digests calculated previously
               and find the matching Disclosure.  If no such Disclosure
               can be found, the digest MUST be ignored.

           2.  If the digest was found in an object's _sd key:

               1.  If the respective Disclosure is not a JSON-encoded
                   array of three elements, the SD-JWT MUST be rejected.

               2.  Insert, at the level of the _sd key, a new claim
                   using the claim name and claim value from the
                   Disclosure.

               3.  If the claim name already exists at the same level,
                   the SD-JWT MUST be rejected.

               4.  Recursively process the value using the steps
                   described in (*) and (**).

           3.  If the digest was found in an array element:

               1.  If the respective Disclosure is not a JSON-encoded
                   array of two elements, the SD-JWT MUST be rejected.

               2.  Replace the array element with the claim value from
                   the Disclosure.

               3.  Recursively process the value using the steps
                   described in (*) and (**).

       4.  If any digests were found more than once in the previous
           step, the SD-JWT MUST be rejected.

       5.  Remove all array elements for which the digest was not found
           in the previous step.

       6.  Remove all _sd keys and their contents from the Issuer-signed
           JWT payload.

       7.  Remove the claim _sd_alg from the SD-JWT payload.

   If any step fails, the SD-JWT is not valid and processing MUST be
   aborted.

   It is up to the Holder how to maintain the mapping between the
   Disclosures and the plaintext claim values to be able to display them
   to the End-User when needed.

6.2.  Processing by the Holder

   If a Key Binding JWT is received by a Holder, the SD-JWT SHOULD be
   rejected.

   For presentation to a Verifier, the Holder MUST perform the following
   (or equivalent) steps:

   1.  Decide which Disclosures to release to the Verifier, obtaining
       proper End-User consent if necessary.

   2.  If Key Binding is required, create a Key Binding JWT.

   3.  Assemble the SD-JWT for Presentation, including the Issuer-signed
       JWT, the selected Disclosures and, if applicable, the Key Binding
       JWT.

   4.  Send the Presentation to the Verifier.

6.3.  Verification by the Verifier

   Upon receiving a Presentation, in addition to the checks outlined in
   Section 6.1, Verifiers MUST ensure that

   *  if Key Binding is required, the Key Binding JWT is signed by the
      Holder and valid.

   To this end, Verifiers MUST follow the following steps (or
   equivalent):

   1.  Determine if Key Binding is to be checked according to the
       Verifier's policy for the use case at hand.  This decision MUST
       NOT be based on whether a Key Binding JWT is provided by the
       Holder or not.  Refer to Section 9.6 for details.

   2.  Process the SD-JWT as defined in Section 6.1.

   3.  If Key Binding is required:

       1.  If Key Binding is provided by means not defined in this
           specification, verify the Key Binding according to the method
           used.

       2.  Otherwise, verify the Key Binding JWT as follows:

           1.  If a Key Binding JWT is not provided, the Verifier MUST
               reject the Presentation.

           2.  Determine the public key for the Holder from the SD-JWT.

           3.  Ensure that a signing algorithm was used that was deemed
               secure for the application.  Refer to [RFC8725], Sections
               3.1 and 3.2 for details.  The none algorithm MUST NOT be
               accepted.

           4.  Validate the signature over the Key Binding JWT.

           5.  Check that the typ of the Key Binding JWT is kb+jwt.

           6.  Check that the creation time of the Key Binding JWT, as
               determined by the iat claim, is within an acceptable
               window.

           7.  Determine that the Key Binding JWT is bound to the
               current transaction and was created for this Verifier
               (replay protection) by validating nonce and aud claims.

           8.  Check that the Key Binding JWT is valid in all other
               respects, per [RFC7519] and [RFC8725].

   If any step fails, the Presentation is not valid and processing MUST
   be aborted.

   Otherwise, the processed SD-JWT payload can be passed to the
   application to be used for the intended purpose.

7.  Enveloping an SD-JWT Presentation

   In some applications or transport protocols, it is desirable to put
   an SD-JWT into an outer JWT container.  For example, an
   implementation may envelope multiple credentials and presentations,
   independent of their format, in a JWT to enable application-layer
   encryption during transport.

   For such use cases, the SD-JWT SHOULD be transported as a single
   string.  Key Binding MAY be achieved by signing the envelope JWT
   instead of including a separate Key Binding JWT in the SD-JWT.

   The claim _sd_jwt SHOULD be used when transporting an SD-JWT unless
   the application or protocol defines a different claim name.

   The following non-normative example shows an SD-JWT Presentation
   enveloped in a JWT payload:

   {
     "iss": "https://holder.example.com",
     "sub": "did:example:123",
     "aud": "https://verifier.example.com",
     "exp": 1590000000,
     "iat": 1580000000,
     "nbf": 1580000000,
     "jti": "urn:uuid:12345678-1234-1234-1234-123456789012",
     "_sd_jwt": "eyJhbGci...emhlaUJhZzBZ~eyJhb...dYALCGg~"
   }

   Here, the SD-JWT is shown where eyJhbGci...emhlaUJhZzBZ represents
   the Issuer-signed JWT and eyJhb...dYALCGg represents a Disclosure.
   The SD-JWT does not contain a Key Binding JWT as the outer container
   can be signed instead.

   Other specifications or profiles of this specification may define
   alternative formats for transporting an SD-JWT that envelope multiple
   such objects into one object, and provides Key Binding using means
   other than the Key Binding JWT.

8.  JWS JSON Serialization

   This section describes an optional alternate format for SD-JWT using
   the JWS JSON Serialization from [RFC7515].

   For both the General and Flattened JSON Serialization, the SD-JWT is
   represented as a JSON object according to Section 7.2 of [RFC7515].
   The disclosures (both for issuance and presentation) are included in
   the serialized JWS using the key disclosures at the top-level of the
   JSON object (the same level as the payload member).  The value of the
   disclosures member is an array of strings where each element is an
   individual Disclosure as described in Section 5.2.  The Issuer
   includes a Disclosure for each selectively disclosable claim of the
   SD-JWT payload, whereas the Holder includes only the Disclosures
   selected for the given presentation.  Additionally, for presentation
   with a Key Binding, the Holder adds the key kb_jwt at the top-level
   of the serialized JWS with a string value containing the Key Binding
   JWT as described in Section 5.10.

   Verification of the JWS JSON serialized SD-JWT follows the same rules
   defined in Section 4.4, except that the SD-JWT does not need to be
   split into component parts, but disclosures and (if applicable) a Key
   Binding JWT can be found in the respective members of the JSON
   object.

   Using a payload similar to that from Example 1 (#example-1), the
   following is a non-normative example of a JWS JSON serialized SD-JWT
   from an Issuer with all the respective Disclosures.

9.  Security Considerations

   Security considerations in this section help achieve the following
   properties:

   *Selective Disclosure:* An adversary in the role of the Verifier
   cannot obtain information from an SD-JWT about any claim name or
   claim value that was not explicitly disclosed by the Holder unless
   that information can be derived from other disclosed claims or
   sources other than the presented SD-JWT.

   *Integrity:* A malicious Holder cannot modify names or values of
   selectively disclosable claims without detection by the Verifier.

   Additionally, as described in Section 9.6, the application of Key
   Binding can ensure that the presenter of an SD-JWT credential is the
   legitimate Holder of the credential.

9.1.  Mandatory Signing of the Issuer-signed JWT

   The Issuer-signed JWT MUST be signed by the Issuer to protect
   integrity of the issued claims.  An attacker can modify or add claims
   if this JWT is not signed (e.g., change the "email" attribute to take
   over the victim's account or add an attribute indicating a fake
   academic qualification).

   The Verifier MUST always check the signature of the Issuer-signed JWT
   to ensure that it has not been tampered with since the issuance.  The
   Issuer-signed JWT MUST be rejected if the signature cannot be
   verified.

   The security of the Issuer-signed JWT depends on the security of the
   signature algorithm.  Any of the JSON Web Signature and Encryption
   Algorithms registered in [IANA.JWS.Algorithms] can be used, including
   post quantum algorithms, when they are ready.

9.2.  Manipulation of Disclosures

   Holders can manipulate the Disclosures by changing the values of the
   claims before sending them to the Verifier.  The Verifier MUST check
   the Disclosures to ensure that the values of the claims are correct,
   i.e., the digests of the Disclosures are actually present in the
   signed SD-JWT.

   A naive Verifier that extracts all claim values from the Disclosures
   (without checking the hashes) and inserts them into the SD-JWT
   payload is vulnerable to this attack.  However, in a structured SD-
   JWT, without comparing the digests of the Disclosures, such an
   implementation could not determine the correct place in a nested
   object where a claim needs to be inserted.  Therefore, the naive
   implementation would not only be insecure, but also incorrect.

   The steps described in Section 6.3 ensure that the Verifier checks
   the Disclosures correctly.

9.3.  Entropy of the salt

   The security model that conceals the plaintext claims relies on the
   fact that salts not revealed to an attacker cannot be learned or
   guessed by the attacker, even if other salts have been revealed.  It
   is vitally important to adhere to this principle.  As such, each salt
   MUST be created in such a manner that it is cryptographically random,
   long enough, and has high entropy that it is not practical for the
   attacker to guess.  A new salt MUST be chosen for each claim
   independently from other salts.

9.4.  Minimum length of the salt

   The RECOMMENDED minimum length of the randomly-generated portion of
   the salt is 128 bits.

   The Issuer MUST ensure that a new salt value is chosen for each
   claim, including when the same claim name occurs at different places
   in the structure of the SD-JWT.  This can be seen in Example 3 in the
   Appendix, where multiple claims with the name type appear, but each
   of them has a different salt.

9.5.  Choice of a Hash Algorithm

   For the security of this scheme, the hash algorithm is required to be
   preimage resistant and second-preimage resistant, i.e., it is
   infeasible to calculate the salt and claim value that result in a
   particular digest, and, for any salt and claim value pair, it is
   infeasible to find a different salt and claim value pair that result
   in the same digest, respectively.

   Hash algorithms that do not meet the aforementioned requirements MUST
   NOT be used.  Inclusion in the "Named Information Hash Algorithm"
   registry [IANA.Hash.Algorithms] alone does not indicate a hash
   algorithm's suitability for use in SD-JWT (it contains several
   heavily truncated digests, such as sha-256-32 and sha-256-64, which
   are unfit for security applications).

   Furthermore, the hash algorithms MD2, MD4, MD5, and SHA-1 revealed
   fundamental weaknesses and they MUST NOT be used.

9.6.  Key Binding

   Key Binding aims to ensure that the presenter of an SD-JWT credential
   is actually the legitimate Holder of the credential.  An SD-JWT with
   Key Binding contains a public key, or a reference to a public key,
   that corresponds to a private key possessed by the Holder.  The
   Verifier requires that the Holder prove possession of that private
   key when presenting the SD-JWT credential.

   Without Key Binding, a Verifier only gets the proof that the
   credential was issued by a particular Issuer, but the credential
   itself can be replayed by anyone who gets access to it.  This means
   that, for example, after a credential was leaked to an attacker, the
   attacker can present the credential to any verifier that does not
   require a binding.  But also a malicious Verifier to which the Holder
   presented the credential can present the credential to another
   Verifier if that other Verifier does not require Key Binding.

   Verifiers MUST decide whether Key Binding is required for a
   particular use case before verifying a credential.  This decision can
   be informed by various factors including, but not limited to the
   following: business requirements, the use case, the type of binding
   between a Holder and its credential that is required for a use case,
   the sensitivity of the use case, the expected properties of a
   credential, the type and contents of other credentials expected to be
   presented at the same time, etc.

   It is important that a Verifier does not make its security policy
   decisions based on data that can be influenced by an attacker or that
   can be misinterpreted.  For this reason, when deciding whether Key
   Binding is required or not, Verifiers MUST NOT take into account

   *  whether a Key Binding JWT is present or not, as an attacker can
      remove the Key Binding JWT from any Presentation and present it to
      the Verifier, or

   *  whether Key Binding data is present in the SD-JWT or not, as the
      Issuer might have added the key to the SD-JWT in a format/claim
      that is not recognized by the Verifier.

   If a Verifier has decided that Key Binding is required for a
   particular use case and the Key Binding is not present, does not
   fulfill the requirements (e.g., on the signing algorithm), or no
   recognized Key Binding data is present in the SD-JWT, the Verifier
   will reject the presentation, as described in Section 6.3.

9.7.  Blinding Claim Names

   SD-JWT ensures that names of claims that are selectively disclosable
   are always blinded.  This prevents an attacker from learning the
   names of the disclosable claims.  However, the names of the claims
   that are not disclosable are not blinded.  This includes the keys of
   objects that themselves are not blinded, but contain disclosable
   claims.  This limitation needs to be taken into account by Issuers
   when creating the structure of the SD-JWT.

9.8.  Issuer Signature Key Distribution and Rotation

   This specification does not define how signature verification keys of
   Issuers are distributed to Verifiers.  However, it is RECOMMENDED
   that Issuers publish their keys in a way that allows for efficient
   and secure key rotation and revocation, for example, by publishing
   keys at a predefined location using the JSON Web Key Set (JWKS)
   format [RFC7517].  Verifiers need to ensure that they are not using
   expired or revoked keys for signature verification using reasonable
   and appropriate means for the given key-distribution method.

9.9.  Forwarding Credentials

   When Key Binding is not enforced, any entity in possession of an SD-
   JWT Presentation can forward the contents to third parties.  When
   doing so, that entity may remove Disclosures such that the receiver
   learns only a subset of the claims contained in the original SD-JWT.

   For example, a device manufacturer might produce an SD-JWT containing
   information about upstream and downstream supply chain contributors.
   Each supply chain party can verify only the claims that were
   selectively disclosed to them by an upstream party, and they can
   choose to further reduce the disclosed claims when presenting to a
   downstream party.

   In some scenarios this behavior could be desirable, but if it is not,
   Issuers need to support and Verifiers need to enforce Key Binding.

9.10.  Explicit Typing

   Section 3.11 of [RFC8725] describes the use of explicit typing to
   prevent confusion attacks in which one kind of JWT is mistaken for
   another.  SD-JWTs are also potentially vulnerable to such confusion
   attacks, so it is RECOMMENDED to specify an explicit type by
   including the typ header parameter when the SD-JWT is issued, and for
   Verifiers to check this value.

   When explicit typing is employed for an SD-JWT, it is RECOMMENDED
   that a media type name of the format "application/example+sd-jwt" be
   used, where "example" is replaced by the identifier for the specific
   kind of SD-JWT.  The definition of typ in Section 4.1.9 of [RFC7515]
   recommends that the "application/" prefix be omitted, so "example+sd-
   jwt" would be the value of the typ header parameter.

10.  Privacy Considerations

   The privacy principles of [ISO.29100] should be adhered to.

10.1.  Storage of Signed User Data

   Wherever End-User data is stored, it represents a potential target
   for an attacker.  This target can be of particularly high value when
   the data is signed by a trusted authority like an official national
   identity service.  For example, in OpenID Connect, signed ID Tokens
   can be stored by Relying Parties.  In the case of SD-JWT, Holders
   have to store SD-JWTs, and Issuers and Verifiers may decide to do so
   as well.

   Not surprisingly, a leak of such data risks revealing private data of
   End-Users to third parties.  Signed End-User data, the authenticity
   of which can be easily verified by third parties, further exacerbates
   the risk.  As discussed in Section 9.6, leaked SD-JWTs may also allow
   attackers to impersonate Holders unless Key Binding is enforced and
   the attacker does not have access to the Holder's cryptographic keys.
   Altogether, leaked SD-JWT credentials may have a high monetary value
   on black markets.

   Due to these risks, systems implementing SD-JWT SHOULD be designed to
   minimize the amount of data that is stored.  All involved parties
   SHOULD store SD-JWTs only for as long as needed, including in log
   files.

   Issuers SHOULD NOT store SD-JWTs after issuance.

   Holders SHOULD store SD-JWTs only in encrypted form, and, wherever
   possible, use hardware-backed encryption in particular for the
   private Key Binding key.  Decentralized storage of data, e.g., on
   End-User devices, SHOULD be preferred for End-User credentials over
   centralized storage.  Expired SD-JWTs SHOULD be deleted as soon as
   possible.

   Verifiers SHOULD NOT store SD-JWTs after verification.  It may be
   sufficient to store the result of the verification and any End-User
   data that is needed for the application.

   If reliable and secure key rotation and revocation is ensured
   according to Section 9.8, Issuers may opt to publish expired or
   revoked private signing keys (after a grace period that ensures that
   the keys are not cached any longer at any Verifier).  This reduces
   the value of any leaked credentials as the signatures on them can no
   longer be trusted to originate from the Issuer.

10.2.  Confidentiality during Transport

   If the SD-JWT is transmitted over an insecure channel during issuance
   or presentation, an adversary may be able to intercept and read the
   End-User's personal data or correlate the information with previous
   uses of the same SD-JWT.

   Usually, transport protocols for issuance and presentation of
   credentials are designed to protect the confidentiality of the
   transmitted data, for example, by requiring the use of TLS.

   This specification therefore considers the confidentiality of the
   data to be provided by the transport protocol and does not specify
   any encryption mechanism.

   Implementers MUST ensure that the transport protocol provides
   confidentiality if the privacy of End-User data or correlation
   attacks by passive observers are a concern.  Implementers MAY define
   an envelope format (such as described in Section 7 or nesting the SD-
   JWT as the plaintext payload of a JWE) to encrypt the SD-JWT when
   transmitted over an insecure channel.

10.3.  Decoy Digests

   The use of decoy digests is RECOMMENDED when the number of claims (or
   the existence of particular claims) can be a side-channel disclosing
   information about otherwise undisclosed claims.  In particular, if a
   claim in an SD-JWT is present only if a certain condition is met
   (e.g., a membership number is only contained if the End-User is a
   member of a group), the Issuer SHOULD add decoy digests when the
   condition is not met.

   Decoy digests increase the size of the SD-JWT.  The number of decoy
   digests (or whether to use them at all) is a trade-off between the
   size of the SD-JWT and the privacy of the End-User's data.

10.4.  Unlinkability

   Colluding Issuer/Verifier or Verifier/Verifier pairs could link
   issuance/presentation or two presentation sessions to the same user
   on the basis of unique values encoded in the SD-JWT (Issuer
   signature, salts, digests, etc.).

   To prevent these types of linkability, various methods, including but
   not limited to the following ones can be used:

   *  Use advanced cryptographic schemes, outside the scope of this
      specification.

   *  Issue a batch of SD-JWTs to the Holder to enable the Holder to use
      a unique SD-JWT per Verifier.  This only helps with Verifier/
      Verifier unlinkability.

10.5.  Issuer Identifier

   An Issuer issuing only one type of SD-JWT might have privacy
   implications, because if the Holder has an SD-JWT issued by that
   Issuer, its type and claim names can be determined.

   For example, if the National Cancer Institute only issued SD-JWTs
   with cancer registry information, it is possible to deduce that the
   Holder owning its SD-JWT is a cancer patient.

   Moreover, the issuer identifier alone may reveal information about
   the user.

   For example, when a military organization or a drug rehabilitation
   center issues a vaccine credential, verifiers can deduce that the
   holder is a military member or may have a substance use disorder.

   To mitigate this issue, a group of issuers may elect to use a common
   Issuer identifier.  A group signature scheme outside the scope of
   this specification may also be used, instead of an individual
   signature.

Appendix A.  Additional Examples

   All of the following examples are non-normative.

A.1.  Example 2: Handling Structured Claims

   This example uses the following object as the set of claims that the
   Issuer is issuing:

   {
     "sub": "6c5c0a49-b589-431d-bae7-219122a9ec2c",
     "given_name": "太郎",
     "family_name": "山田",
     "email": "\"unusual email address\"@example.jp",
     "phone_number": "+81-80-1234-5678",
     "address": {
       "street_address": "東京都港区芝公園４丁目２−８",
       "locality": "東京都",
       "region": "港区",
       "country": "JP"
     },
     "birthdate": "1940-01-01"
   }

   In contrast to Example 1 (#example-1), here the Issuer decided to
   create a structured object for the address claim, allowing for
   separate disclosure of the individual members of the claim, and also
   added decoy digests to prevent the Verifier from deducing the true
   number of claims.  The following payload is used for the SD-JWT:

   {
     "_sd": [
       "C9inp6YoRaEXR427zYJP7Qrk1WH_8bdwOA_YUrUnGQU",

A.2.  Example 3 - Complex Structured SD-JWT

   In this example, an SD-JWT with a complex object is demonstrated.
   Here, the data structures defined in OIDC4IDA [OIDC.IDA] are used.

   The Issuer is using the following user data:

   {
     "verified_claims": {
       "verification": {
         "trust_framework": "de_aml",
         "time": "2012-04-23T18:25Z",
         "verification_process": "f24c6f-6d3f-4ec5-973e-b0d8506f3bc7",
         "evidence": [
           {
             "type": "document",
             "method": "pipp",
             "time": "2012-04-22T11:30Z",
             "document": {
               "type": "idcard",
               "issuer": {
                 "name": "Stadt Augsburg",
                 "country": "DE"
               },
               "number": "53554554",
               "date_of_issuance": "2010-03-23",
               "date_of_expiry": "2020-03-22"
             }
           }
         ]
       },
       "claims": {
         "given_name": "Max",
         "family_name": "Müller",
         "nationalities": [
           "DE"
         ],
         "birthdate": "1956-01-28",
         "place_of_birth": {
           "country": "IS",
           "locality": "Þykkvabæjarklaustur"
         },
         "address": {
           "locality": "Maxstadt",
           "postal_code": "12344",
           "country": "DE",
           "street_address": "Weidenstraße 22"
         }
       }
     },
     "birth_middle_name": "Timotheus",
     "salutation": "Dr.",
     "msisdn": "49123456789"
   }

   The Issuer in this example sends the two claims birthdate and
   place_of_birth in the claims element in plain text.  The following
   shows the resulting SD-JWT payload:

   {
     "_sd": [
       "-aSznId9mWM8ocuQolCllsxVggq1-vHW4OtnhUtVmWw",

     ],
     "iss": "https://example.com/issuer",

A.3.  Example 4a - W3C Verifiable Credentials Data Model v2.0, not using
      JSON-LD

   This example illustrates how to use the artifacts defined in this
   specification to secure a payload that is represented as a W3C
   Verifiable Credentials Data Model v2.0 [VC_DATA_v2.0] and does not
   use JSON-LD to provide semantic definitions for claims.  The example
   uses a content type credential-claims-set+json defined in [VC_JWT],
   Section 3 in a cty JOSE Header value.

   SD-JWT is equivalent to an Issuer-signed W3C Verifiable Credential
   (W3C VC).  Disclosures are sent alongside a W3C VC.

   A Holder-signed Verifiable Presentation as defined in [VC_DATA_v2.0]
   is equivalent to an SD-JWT Presentation with a Key Binding JWT.

   In this example, Key Binding is applied and Verifiable Presentation
   can be signed using a Holder's public key passed in a cnf Claim in
   the SD-JWT.

   Below is a non-normative example of an SD-JWT represented as a W3C VC
   without using JSON-LD.

   The following data will be used in this example:

   {
     "iss": "https://example.com",
     "jti": "http://example.com/credentials/3732",
     "nbf": 1541493724,

         "locality": "Anytown",
         "region": "Anystate",
         "country": "US"
       },
       "birthdate": "1940-01-01",
       "is_over_18": true,
       "is_over_21": true,

A.4.  Example 4b - W3C Verifiable Credentials Data Model v2.0, using
      JSON-LD

   This example illustrates how to use the artifacts defined in this
   specification to secure a payload that is represented as a W3C
   Verifiable Credentials Data Model v2.0 [VC_DATA_v2.0] and uses a
   JSON-LD object as the claims set.  The example uses a content type
   credential+ld+json defined in [VC_DATA_v2.0], Section 6.3 in a cty
   JOSE Header value.

   SD-JWT is equivalent to an Issuer-signed W3C Verifiable Credential
   (W3C VC).  Disclosures are sent alongside a VC.

   An SD-JWT Presentation with a Key Binding JWT would be equivalent to
   a Holder-signed Verifiable Presentation as defined in [VC_DATA_v2.0].

   In this example, Key Binding is applied using the Holder's public key
   passed in a cnf Claim in the SD-JWT.

   Below is a non-normative example of an SD-JWT represented as a W3C VC
   using JSON-LD.

   The following data will be used in this example:

   {
     "@context": [
       "https://www.w3.org/2018/credentials/v1",
       "https://w3id.org/vaccination/v1"

A.5.  Elliptic Curve Key Used in the Examples

   The following Elliptic Curve public key, represented in JWK format,
   can be used to validate the Issuer signatures in the above examples:

   {
     "kty": "EC",
     "crv": "P-256",
     "x": "b28d4MwZMjw8-00CG4xfnn9SLMVMM19SlqZpVb_uNtQ",
     "y": "Xv5zWwuoaTgdS6hV43yI6gBwTnjukmFQQnJ_kCxzqk8"
   }

   The public key used to validate a Key Binding JWT can be found in the
   examples as the content of the cnf claim.

Appendix B.  Disclosure Format Considerations

   As described in Section 5.2, the Disclosure structure is JSON
   containing salt and the cleartext content of a claim, which is
   base64url encoded.  The encoded value is the input used to calculate
   a digest for the respective claim.  The inclusion of digest value in
   the signed JWT ensures the integrity of the claim value.  Using
   encoded content as the input to the integrity mechanism is
   conceptually similar to the approach in JWS and particularly useful
   when the content, like JSON, can have differences but be semantically
   equivalent.  Some further discussion of the considerations around
   this design decision follows.

   When receiving an SD-JWT, a Verifier must be able to re-compute
   digests of the disclosed claim values and, given the same input
   values, obtain the same digest values as signed by the Issuer.

   Usually, JSON-based formats transport claim values as simple
   properties of a JSON object such as this:

   ...
     "family_name": "Möbius",
     "address": {
       "street_address": "Schulstr. 12",
       "locality": "Schulpforta"
     }
   ...

   However, a problem arises when computation over the data need to be
   performed and verified, like signing or computing digests.  Common
   signature schemes require the same byte string as input to the
   signature verification as was used for creating the signature.  In
   the digest approach outlined above, the same problem exists: for the
   Issuer and the Verifier to arrive at the same digest, the same byte
   string must be hashed.

   JSON, however, does not prescribe a unique encoding for data, but
   allows for variations in the encoded string.  The data above, for
   example, can be encoded as

   ...
   "family_name": "M\u00f6bius",
   "address": {
     "street_address": "Schulstr. 12",
     "locality": "Schulpforta"
   }
   ...

   or as

  ...
  "family_name": "Möbius",
  "address": {"locality":"Schulpforta", "street_address":"Schulstr. 12"}
  ...

   The two representations of the value in family_name are very
   different on the byte-level, but yield equivalent objects.  Same for
   the representations of address, varying in white space and order of
   elements in the object.

   The variations in white space, ordering of object properties, and
   encoding of Unicode characters are all allowed by the JSON
   specification, including further variations, e.g., concerning
   floating-point numbers, as described in [RFC8785].  Variations can be
   introduced whenever JSON data is serialized or deserialized and
   unless dealt with, will lead to different digests and the inability
   to verify signatures.

   There are generally two approaches to deal with this problem:

   1.  Canonicalization: The data is transferred in JSON format,
       potentially introducing variations in its representation, but is
       transformed into a canonical form before computing a digest.
       Both the Issuer and the Verifier must use the same
       canonicalization algorithm to arrive at the same byte string for
       computing a digest.

   2.  Source string hardening: Instead of transferring data in a format
       that may introduce variations, a representation of the data is
       serialized.  This representation is then used as the hashing
       input at the Verifier, but also transferred to the Verifier and
       used for the same digest calculation there.  This means that the
       Verifier can easily compute and check the digest of the byte
       string before finally deserializing and accessing the data.

   Mixed approaches are conceivable, i.e., transferring both the
   original JSON data plus a string suitable for computing a digest, but
   such approaches can easily lead to undetected inconsistencies
   resulting in time-of-check-time-of-use type security vulnerabilities.

   In this specification, the source string hardening approach is used,
   as it allows for simple and reliable interoperability without the
   requirement for a canonicalization library.  To harden the source
   string, any serialization format that supports the necessary data
   types could be used in theory, like protobuf, msgpack, or pickle.  In
   this specification, JSON is used and plain text values of each
   Disclosure are encoded using base64url-encoding for transport.  This
   approach means that SD-JWTs can be implemented purely based on widely
   available JWT, JSON, and Base64 encoding and decoding libraries.

   A Verifier can then easily check the digest over the source string
   before extracting the original JSON data.  Variations in the encoding
   of the source string are implicitly tolerated by the Verifier, as the
   digest is computed over a predefined byte string and not over a JSON
   object.

   It is important to note that the Disclosures are neither intended nor
   suitable for direct consumption by an application that needs to
   access the disclosed claim values after the verification by the
   Verifier.  The Disclosures are only intended to be used by a Verifier
   to check the digests over the source strings and to extract the
   original JSON data.  The original JSON data is then used by the
   application.  See Section 6.3 for details.
