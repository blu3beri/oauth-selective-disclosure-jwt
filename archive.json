(Something the use-cases still need to clarify is the fact that the issuer is known. Still waiting for some additional feedback.)\r\n\r\n--\r\nThat's what I thought. Another question would be: For structured claim objects (cf. eKYC & IDA Spec), do we need to hide the structure? The structure itself might be revealing some information.\r\n--\r\nI can imagine the cases where an issuer would be issuing only one type of credentials with fixed structure and claimset. That means, if you know the issuer, you can pretty much find out the structure and claim names in it. So, hiding the structure and claim names would not add much.\r\n--\r\nI would assume that is the default.\r\n--\r\nI agree\r\n--\r\nIn ekyc, the structure alone can reveal the type of evidence used, which might leak info about e.g. nationality. \r\n\r\nBut these cases might be rare and I'd also like to keep it simple for now.\r\n--\r\nRight. At the same time, you typically want to know the nationality in the case of EKYC in financial institutions :-) \r\n\r\nSpeaking of that, I was assuming that in a lot of cases, the receiver may need to know the type of credential especially when the issuer was issuing multiple types of credentials at different assurance levels. Is this assumption bogus?\r\n--\r\nThat's a valid assumption. Verifier needs to know the level of assurance of the VC and in most cases (I guess) it will need to know under what policies the holder keys are created/stored/... (or if it can trust the wallet where the Verifiable Presentation was created and is shared from)\r\n--\r\n",

This protects against accidental leakage if the SVC ends up in log files or get exfiltrated somehow (privacy preserving by default). Since the SVC is now private to the holder, it can be included in the SD-JWT as an attribute, so no need to send two artefacts, you can just send one.

Which eliminates the possibility of relying on the claim values from the SVC while forgetting to to do the integrity check. And yes, as you point out, that check is fundamental. But mistakes like that do happen and have happened. And, so to the extent possible/reasonable, it's good if the protocol design can eliminate or reduce the possibility of making common mistakes.\r\n\r\nWith this proposed approach, the SD-JWT is bigger. And the disclosure container will be smaller than the SVC.\r\n\r\nIt could be something different but I used plain JWE for the encrypted values. Which has the benefit of reusing the JWE spec and concepts. And should mean that JWE libraries already have the code to process the stuff. So from that perspective, I don't actually think it would impact adoption and simplicity. In some ways, it's simpler. And algorithm agility comes \"for free\" from the JWE layer. \r\n\r\nJWE isn't the most space efficient. But it's not terrible. And there are some potential optimizations that could be looked at too, if desired. The likely redundant JWE header looks like a good candidate. But I digress for now... \r\n\r\nSome info about the size of the underlying data does maybe leak here (b/c the cipher text size will vary with the size of the plain text) vs. the hash. But I'm having a hard time seeing how that could be meaningfully consequential in this context. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

I always feel uncomfortable when symmetric keys are being sent in the clear. If we added confidentiality protection for the symmetric keys it can be done using established key management techniques. I imagine an approach where the structure with the symmetric keys are encrypted with the holder public key. When the holder wants to perform disclosure, the holder decrypt the structure, extract the key it wants to share, create the disclosure document and then encrypts it with the verifiers public key. The verifier would then decrypt the disclosure structure, extract the symmetric keys, and decrypt the fields in the JD-SWT.\r\n\r\nThe benefit of protecting the encryption keys is that it mitigates against accidental disclosure if the structure with the symmetric keys gets logged/exfiltrated, and the holder can store it as received from the issuer (protecting data at rest).\r\n\r\nThe downside is extra key management, but perhaps a worthwhile option given that we are building a privacy preserving capability.",

Implicitly, since authenticated encryption is used, the verifier would validate that the claim values have not been modified.\r\n\r\nThis is a nice construction as it combines the advantages of the hash and encryption approaches: The verifier cannot skip the check of the signature and the SD-JWT remains fairly small. Also, we don't unnecessarily share encrypted values.\r\n\r\nNow here's the problem: \r\n\r\n- If we use symmetric encryption, the holder would be able to create new ciphertexts for the signed keys. We can't allow that, so we must use **asymmetric encryption**.\r\n- This means that the issuer creates a key pair (public/private) for each claim value. If the issuer now uses (as usual) the public key to encrypt the claim values, he would need to **sign/share the private key in the SD-JWT.** That's bad, not only because private keys are not meant to be shared, but because you can often derive the public key from the private key and the holder could again create new ciphertexts. [Somebody (@christianpaquin @PieterKas) correct me if I'm wrong, but as far as I know \"you can't derive the public key from the private key\" is not a guarantee any encryption algorithm available in JOSE provides.]\r\n- Therefore, the issuer has to use the *private* key to encrypt and then sign/share the *public* key. This is essentially what happens in signatures, but the problem is, that JWE does not foresee this. This means that it is probably not easy to implement or error-prone when attempted.\r\n\r\nAlso, performance considerations.",

The idea is to use the authentication tag of a symmetric JWE similar to the hash value in the salted hash approach. Then include the rest of the JWE in the release container for each claim. For each released claim, the verifier appends the tag on the back of the rest of the JWE and decrypts to get the value. Because it's authenticated encryption, the decryption includes an integrity check. Treating the authenticated decryption as a single operation (which isn't strictly true but you'd have to go out of you way to separate them and mess it up) means the verifier cannot skip the tag/hash check while accessing the claim values. And the tags are under the signature of the SD-JWT. A bit more detail with examples follows.\r\n\r\nA symmetric encryption key is put in the `sd_tags` container of SD-JWT.

          "body": "> FWIW, I'll briefly describe another solution here that I came up with during our call on Friday - and say why it doesn't work.\r\n> \r\n> The idea I had was that the issuer creates an encryption key for each claim value, encrypts the claim value, and provides the _key_ - not the ciphertext - in the SD-JWT. The SVC would contain the ciphertexts instead of the keys, and the holder would release a subset of the ciphertexts to the verifier. The verifier would use the keys signed by the issuer plus the ciphertexts to get the claim values. Implicitly, since authenticated encryption is used, the verifier would validate that the claim values have not been modified.\r\n> \r\n> This is a nice construction as it combines the advantages of the hash and encryption approaches: The verifier cannot skip the check of the signature and the SD-JWT remains fairly small. Also, we don't unnecessarily share encrypted values.\r\n> \r\n> Now here's the problem:\r\n> \r\n> * If we use symmetric encryption, the holder would be able to create new ciphertexts for the signed keys. We can't allow that, so we must use **asymmetric encryption**.\r\n> * This means that the issuer creates a key pair (public/private) for each claim value. If the issuer now uses (as usual) the public key to encrypt the claim values, he would need to **sign/share the private key in the SD-JWT.** That's bad, not only because private keys are not meant to be shared, but because you can often derive the public key from the private key and the holder could again create new ciphertexts. [Somebody (@christianpaquin @PieterKas) correct me if I'm wrong, but as far as I know \"you can't derive the public key from the private key\" is not a guarantee any encryption algorithm available in JOSE provides.]\r\n> * Therefore, the issuer has to use the _private_ key to encrypt and then sign/share the _public_ key. This is essentially what happens in signatures, but the problem is, that JWE does not foresee this. This means that it is probably not easy to implement or error-prone when attempted.\r\n> \r\n> Also, performance considerations.\r\n\r\n@danielfett I was thinking about the practical implications of the proposal  after our call and agree that in practice there will be opportunities for implementation errors. \r\n\r\nIn theory, the mathematical properties of public and private key pairs are equivalent. However, most implementations optimise for speed by picking fixed values and parameters (in the case of RSA, the public exponent is often short and fixed as 65537). It often also includes other parameters that can be used to compute intermediate steps, which in turn may be handy when optimising the implementation, but ends up helping the cryptanalyst. It could be overcome, but would make use of standard crypto libraries difficult, leading to the point of custom crypto library implementations, which is worse in my view than the ill we are trying to cure (comparing hashes). So agreed that this particular approach may not get us there, but @bc-pi iteration looks interesting ;)",

If the attacker knows the key + tag, it's apparently not too difficult to forge a message with new ciphertext that authenticates against the same tag.  I was (apparently naively) thinking that the AEAD tag provides similar properties to a secure hash or hmac (one of the JWE constructions uses AES CBC + HMAC SHA2 to provide an AEAD, which influenced my thinking) - particularly something like second preimage resistance that would make such forgery infeasible - but sounds like my assumption there is wrong.

Hashing, as currently in the main branch. Cons: The potential footgun of missing the hash check, slightly awkward JSON-in-JSON encoding. Pros: Aligned with mDL and established there, relatively compact, easy to implement.\r\n2. Encryption with release of key. Cons: A length sidechannel, having to select algorithms carefully, and potentially very large SD-JWTs. Relying on lesser used features (JWE instead of JWS+hashing). Pros: No footgun for the verifier.\r\n3. Encryption with tag/key in SD-JWT and release of ciphertext. Cons: Relying on a crypto property we should not rely on. Pros: No footgun, smaller SD-JWTs.\r\n\r\nI think it is clear that (3) is out. \r\nComparing (1) and (2), I think that (1) is the better option. Yes, the footgun of (1) is a large one, but at least it is only one.

In that approach the issuer will generate a SD-JWT that contains the hashes and the SVC. The SVC will be encrypted with the holders public key, so that a verifier cannot access the SVC data. \r\n\r\nThe holder will decrypt the SVC structure in the SD-JWT, decide which claims to present, and then include them in the SD-JWT-R. To avoi concatenation of the SD-JWT and SD-JWT-R, the SD-JWT can include the SD-JWT as an attribute.

We already know that tokens and authorization codes end up in log files, and the SVC will as well. Attackers will (and do) hoover up these artefacts, so protecting their contents seems appropriate. I worry about designing a privacy preserving feature that passes the data it seeks to control around in cleartext. \r\n\r\nIn terms of complexity, encrypting the entire structure will be much simpler than the field level encryption being proposed in https://github.com/oauthstuff/draft-selective-disclosure-jwt/issues/30. From an implementation perspective we already encrypt token contents in certain cases to preserve privacy, so there is evidence that this can be achieved at scale. Encrypting an entire structure with a single key does come across as simpler than encrypting each field with a different \r\n\r\nThe concerns about weak keys and weak algorithms can be addressed by specifying the algorithm suits that should be used and avoiding constructs like Alg:NONE. Conformance suites can enforce this in time. \r\n\r\nIt is an interesting point to consider forward secrecy in the context of selective disclosure. There are ways to solve for that through algorithm selection, ephemeral keys or just rolling keys. It still feels like a better problem to have than not protecting the SVC at all and probably applies to https://github.com/oauthstuff/draft-selective-disclosure-jwt/issues/30 as well. I do agree that including the encrypted SVC in the SD-JWT expands the impact of a future algorithm failure as there are more places where the encrypted payload will be available. However, encrypting the SVC and keeping it outside of the SD-JT still feels like a better option, even in the face of a possible future algorithm compromise (at least there is some protection in the present).",

The verifier must always check the signature to ensure that the SD-JWT has not been tampered with and that the claims included were not modified since the SD-JWT was signed by the issuer. If the signature on the SD-JWT cannot be verified the SD-JWT should be rejected. If the SD-JWT is not signed, an attacker may modify claims (e.g. change the \"sub\" attribute to identify another subject or \"address\" to modify a shipping address for goods ordered), thereby forging the issuer assertion. An attacker may also choose to add optional claims that the issuer had not asserted (e.g. adding an attribute indicating an academic qualification).\r\n\r\n",

          "body": "My two eurocents on this: A clearer distinction between the different JWTs and JSON documents we're dealing with will help to inform the decision on this issue.\r\n\r\n* We do have the SD-JWT, a normal JWT with the special claim `sd_digests`.\r\n* Then there is the SVC, let's ignore that for a moment.\r\n* Then the SD-JWT-R, another normal JWT (or a plain JSON structure) with some special claims.\r\n* Finally, the verifier may synthesize a data structure from the SD-JWT plus the SD-JWT-R. This data structure contains the same data an application would otherwise maybe have received via a JWT from the issuer directly, and its integrity can be traced back to the issuer as well. Let's call this data the **result** (of the SD-JWT(-R) verification).\r\n\r\nThis result will have the same claim names as ID Tokens in some cases. In some cases, it might look like an access token according to RFC9068. In other cases, will conform to <insert_spec_here>.\r\n\r\nBut the SD-JWT that was the basis for this result will never be an ID token, or an RFC9068 compliant access token, or an <insert_spec_here> compliant token, because it uses a special claims container (`sd_digests`), and the claim values are hashes, not actual claim values. Maybe the structure is completely different.\r\n\r\nTherefore, the `typ` of the original SD-JWT cannot be `jwt` or `at+jwt` or `<insert_spec_here>+jwt`. If anything, it should be something like `sd+jwt`. Same for the SD-JWT-R, maybe the `typ` should be `sd-r+jwt` as proposed before.\r\n\r\nBut: There might be room for another `typ`-like information, maybe in a new claim `sd_headers`, to indicate what the `typ` of the result will be:\r\n\r\n```\r\n{\r\n  \"typ\": \"sd+jwt\"\r\n}.\r\n{\r\n  \"iss\": \"https://example.com/issuer\",\r\n  \"sub_jwk\": {\r\n    \"kty\": \"RSA\",\r\n    \"n\": \"pm4bOHBg-oYhAyPWzR56AWX3rUIXp11_ICDkGgS6W3ZWLts-hzwI3x65659kg4hVo9dbGoCJE3ZGF_eaetE30UhBUEgpGwrDrQiJ9zqprmcFfr3qvvkGjtth8Zgl1eM2bJcOwE7PCBHWTKWYs152R7g6Jg2OVph-a8rq-q79MhKG5QoW_mTz10QT_6H4c7PjWG1fjh8hpWNnbP_pv6d1zSwZfc5fl6yVRL0DV0V3lGHKe2Wqf_eNGjBrBLVklDTk8-stX_MWLcR-EGmXAOv0UBWitS_dXJKJu-vXJyw14nHSGuxTIK2hx1pttMft9CsvqimXKeDTU14qQL1eE7ihcw\",\r\n    \"e\": \"AQAB\"\r\n  },\r\n  \"iat\": 1516239022,\r\n  \"exp\": 1516247022,\r\n  \"sd_headers\": {\r\n    \"typ\": \"something+jwt\"\r\n  },\r\n  \"sd_digests\": {\r\n    \"sub\": \"LbnhkOr5oS7KjeUrxezAu8TG0CpWz0jSixy6tffuo04\",\r\n    \"given_name\": \"fUMdn88aaoyKTHrvZd6AuLmPraGhPJ0zF5r_JhxCVZs\",\r\n    \"family_name\": \"9h5vgv6TpFV6GmnPtugiMLl5tHetHeb5X_2cKHjN7cw\",\r\n    \"email\": \"fPZ92dtYMCN2Nb-2ac_zSH19p4yakUXrZl_-wSgaazA\",\r\n    \"phone_number\": \"QdSffzNzzd0n60MsSmuiKj6Y6Enk2b-BS-KtEePde5M\",\r\n    \"address\": \"JFu99NUXPq55f6DFBZ22rMkxMNHayCrfPG0FDsqbyDs\",\r\n    \"birthdate\": \"Ia1Tc6_Xnt5CJc2LtKcu6Wvqr42glBGGcjGOye8Zf3U\"\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nA verifier could use this information to reject the SD-JWT early without checking anything else, and to avoid type confusion attacks as usual.",

Leave that to the application to use (or not) as appropriate. But `\"typ\": \"sd+jwt\"` isn't really meaningful or useful on it's own (similar to `\"typ\": \"JWT\"`, the WTF from RFC7519) and so we don't need special SD-JWT features for it. \r\n\r\nIt _maybe_ worthwhile to define media type(s) for the combined format(s) that could be used to signal what the thing is in like HTTP `Content-Type` or `cty` header of an enclosing JWE.

      "body": "# Comments\r\nFrom the current version of the document, the security and privacy target is not really defined but only a mechanism is defined as \u201cAn SD-JWT, at its core, is a digitally signed document containing hashes over the claim values with unique salts and other metadata. It MUST be digitally signed using the issuer's private key\u201d. Explicitly defining security and privacy goals may be desired. \r\n\r\n# Proposal\r\n \r\nAdd the following at the beginning of \u201cConcept\u201d\r\n\r\nFrom the point of view of the collection limitation, which is one of the main privacy principles, it is desirable to be able to provide only the claims necessary for the verifier to process. In the case of a standard JWT [RFC7519], however, this can only be achieved when the JWT is minted afresh each time and it is not possible to re-use the JWT that is pre-minted for other occasions. For example, a holder may want to re-use the document that contains name, address (municipality, street address, room number), date of birth, and National Identification Number to prove that he is a resident of the municipality so that he can receive the service to the resident. In the case of the normal JWT, this is not possible as the signature is over the entire claim set directly. To achieve it, a JWT that only contains the claim about the municipality needs to be minted. \r\n\r\nSelective disclosure JWT (SD-JWT) aims to address this issue by introducing an indirection: sign the salted hash of the claims instead of the claim set and provide only the claim value of the claim that is required to be processed by the receiver, which assumes the verifier role. This way, while the claim names and the salted hash of the claim values of all the claims contained in the document issued by the issuer is disclosed, the claim values of other claims are not in principle. \r\n\r\nIn this document, a protocol is considered to fulfil the selective disclosure property when it has the following properties: \r\n\r\n## R1. Strong uncoverability\r\n\r\nA protocol is said to achieve strong uncoverability if the adversary acting as the verifier cannot successfully find the claim values that were not intended to be disclosed to the verifier, with a probability significantly better than negligible. \r\n\r\n## R2. Weak uncoverability\r\n\r\nWhile strong uncoverability is desirable, it is not trivial to achieve it. For example, if the original document was a passport that came with the signature of the national authority, then just by looking at the issuer and its signature, it is trivial to find the nationality of the subject in the release. Also, if the existence of the claim name in the release makes it possible for the verifier to guess the value with a probability significantly better than negligible, then it does not satisfy strong uncoverability. \r\n\r\nWith these considerations, weak uncoverability is defined as follows: \r\n\r\nA protocol is said to achieve weak uncoverability if the adversary acting as the verifier cannot successfully find the claim values that were not intended to be disclosed to the verifier from the section of the release that directly corresponds with the claim, with a probability significantly better than negligible.  \r\n\r\n## R3. Release confidentiality\r\n\r\nA protocol is said to achieve release confidentiality if the adversary that can observe the content of all protocol exchanges between the holder agent and the verifier cannot find the claims with a probability significantly better than negligible. \r\n\r\n## R4. Unforgeability\r\n\r\nUnforegeability ensures that an adversary acting as a holder (dishonest holder) cannot forge a release that makes the verifier believe the false value.  \r\n\r\nThe game is defined as follows. Arbitrary entities play the role of issuer and verifier while the adversary plays the role of the holder at each stage of the protocol. A is subjected to the game where sequentially: \r\n\r\n1. Issuer and verifier execute the setup/registration phase (if any). \r\n2. Issuer and adversary playing the role of holder execute the issuance phase in which issuer issues claim set attached to the honest holder C to the adversary. \r\n3. Adversary playing the role of holder and verifier executes the release phase for a policy P that is not satisfied by C. \r\n4. The winning event for the adversary is defined as a successful authentication towards the verifier. \r\n\r\nThe protocol achieves unforgeability if it is unfeasible for the adversary to win with a probability significantly better than negligible. \r\n\r\n## Security and privacy target of SD-JWT and SD-JWT release\r\n\r\nT1. SD-JWT, SD-JWT release with associated protocol execution fulfils R2, R3, and R4. \r\n\r\nNote: See privacy consideration for more discussion.",

SD-JWT does not allow the attacker to create a release that would make verifier to trust claim values not originally signed by the issuer.\r\n \r\n- On 1 and 2, this is where in my mind this cannot be achieved only by using SD-JWT, but requires other \"protocols\". Plain text release contains actual claim values! so to achieve this property, release has to be sent over TLS, or session encrypted BLE/NFC, but we cannot force that in this SD-JWT document itself. and this is where audience restriction and nonces also come into play.\r\n- On 3, I agree with this one. it is achieved by including hashes in SD-JWT, but can be undermined if verifier does not perform hash computation.",

      "body": "# Comment\r\nWhile many people attached in this field seem to focus on loosely defined notion of unlinkability, it is not only the factor to be considered. Also, the notion of unlinkability can be more regorously defined as in ISO/IEC 27551 and it is essential to consider in that rigor. \r\n\r\n# Proposal: \r\nUse the following text. \r\n\r\n# Privacy considerations\r\n\r\nPrivacy protection can be considered from the following principles per ISO/IEC 29100.  \r\n\r\n\t1.\tConsent and choice \r\n\t2.\tPurpose legitimacy and specification \r\n\t3.\tCollection limitation \r\n\t4.\tData minimization \r\n\t5.\tUse, retention and disclosure limitation \r\n\t6.\tAccuracy and quality \r\n\t7.\tOpenness, transparency and notice \r\n\t8.\tIndividual participation and access \r\n\t9.\tAccountability \r\n\t10.\tInformation security \r\n\t11.\tPrivacy compliance \r\n\r\nAmong them, this document is concerned directly with 3. Collection limitation and indirectly/partially with 1. Consent and choice, 2. Purpose legitimacy and specification, 6. Accuracy and quality, and 10. Information security.  \r\n\r\nOften talked unlinkability is a subset of 3. Collection limitation as it amounts to providing unintended (by the holder) information such as the fact that the holder visited a verifier to another verifier. \r\n\r\n## Collection limitation\r\n\r\nIn this document, Collection limitation is considered from two aspects. \r\n\r\n1. Uncoverability\r\n2. Unlinkability\r\n\r\n### Uncoverability\r\n\r\nThe concept of uncoverability was discussed in clause 3. In this subclause, this document further discusses it in more detail. \r\n\r\n#### Uncovering the values of non-existent claims from issuer identifier\r\nWhen an issuer issues only one type of SD-JWT, it is often possible to recover some attributes about the holder. \r\nFor example, if the issuer was an authority that only issues driver's licenses in this format, \r\nthen, just by looking at the issuer and the document itself, it can be deterministically recovered that the holder has a driving license. While revealing that the holder has a driving license may not have much privacy impact, \r\nif it was other attributes, it could be quite a privacy-sensitive. \r\n\r\nFor example, suppose the case where the SD-JWT was issued by National Cancer Centre. \r\nThen, by just looking at the issuer, it is possible to deduce that the holder is a cancer patient. \r\nThis may have a fair amount of privacy impact. \r\n\r\nTo mitigate this kind of issue, a group of issuers may elect to use a common issuer identifier and use a group signature scheme instead of an individual signature. \r\n\r\n#### Uncovering the values of non-existent claims from the list of claim names\r\nEven if a group of issuers uses a common issuer identifier, if the claims used are unique from one issuer to another, \r\nthe list of the claim names would be enough to identify the real issuer. In this case, the values of non-existent claims can be uncovered in the same manner as described in the previous subclause. \r\n\r\nTo mitigate this kind of issue, the group of issuers may elect to use a common set of claims and always include them in the SD-JWT. \r\n\r\n#### Uncovering the claim value where the number of possible values is limited\r\n\r\nWhen the number of possible values of the claim is limited, it is trivial to uncover the actual value from the salt and the hash. \r\nIt suffices to iterate over the possible values with the provided hash. \r\n\r\nTo mitigate this kind of issue, the issuer may add a random string to provide entropy at the end of the actual value with an appropriate delimiter in the case the value is a string. For other data types like boolean, some other mechanisms should be considered, e.g., defining a transform from boolean to a string using the entropy string. \r\n\r\n\r\n### Unlinkability\r\n\r\nThe notion of unlinkability cannot be defined precisely without specifying the role assumed by the adversary and the target of the attack. In ISO/IEC 27551, the following notation is used to describe a different kind of unlinkability. \r\n\r\n    (Adversary)\u2013(Target) Unlinkability\r\n\r\nNOTE: The notation is modified to group the Adversary and Target with a parenthesis to make it easier to read when adopted this document's entity name. \r\n\r\nIn the case two parties are colluding as the adversary, the colluding parties are concatenated with \"+\" sign to express it. \r\n\r\n    (Adversar1+Adversary2)\u2013(Target) Unlinkability\r\n\r\nThe same applies to the target. \r\n\r\nWith this notation, ISO/IEC 27551 defines the following eight types of unlinkability. (Entity names are modified to match this document. Corresponding ISO/IEC 27551 unlinkability names are given in braces after it). \r\n\r\n1. (Passive Outsider)\u2013(Holder) Unlinkability [PO-U]\r\n2. (Active Outsider)\u2013(Holder) Unlinkability [AO-U]\r\n3. (Verifier 1 + Verifier 2)\u2013(Holder) Unlinkability [RP+RP'\u2013U]\r\n4. (Issuer)\u2013(Holder) Unlinkability [AP\u2013U]\r\n5. (Verifier)\u2013(Holder) Unlinkability [RP\u2013U]\r\n6. (Issuer)\u2013(Verifier) Unlinkability [AP\u2013RP]\r\n7. (Issuer+Verifier)\u2013(Holder) Unlinkability [AP+RP-U]\r\n8. (Issuer)\u2013(Holder+Verifier) Unlinkability [AP-RP+U]\r\n\r\n#### (Passive Outsider)\u2013(Holder) Unlinkability [PO-U]\r\nWhen all the protocol runs are encrypted, e.g., by TLS, then a Passive Outside cannot see the content of SD-JWT and SD-JWT-R. \r\nIn other words, the protocol runs should be encrypted to achieve this unlinkability. \r\n\r\n####  (Active Outsider)\u2013(Holder) Unlinkability [AO-U]\r\n\r\n(TBD)\r\n\r\n#### (Verifier 1 + Verifier 2)\u2013(Holder) Unlinkability [RP+RP'\u2013U]\r\n\r\n(TBD)\r\n\r\n#### (Issuer)\u2013(Holder) Unlinkability [AP\u2013U]\r\n\r\n(TBD)\r\n\r\n#### (Verifier)\u2013(Holder) Unlinkability [RP\u2013U]\r\n\r\n(TBD)\r\n\r\n#### (Issuer)\u2013(Verifier) Unlinkability [AP\u2013RP]\r\n\r\n(TBD)\r\n\r\n#### (Issuer+Verifier)\u2013(Holder) Unlinkability [AP+RP-U]\r\n\r\n(TBD)\r\n\r\n#### (Issuer)\u2013(Holder+Verifier) Unlinkability [AP-RP+U]\r\n\r\n(TBD)\r\n\r\n## Consent and choice\r\n\r\n(TBD)\r\n\r\n\r\n## Purpose legitimacy and specification\r\n\r\n(TBD)\r\n\r\n\r\n## Accuracy and quality\r\n\r\n(TBD)\r\n\r\n\r\n## Information security\r\n\r\n(TBD)\r\n\r\n",

Is it possible to update the IANA registry with a Recommended Y/N column? Also, shake128 and shake256 are not collision-resistant hash functions, they are XOFs that can produce any length of output - e.g. shake128 with a 32-bit output would not be collision-resistant and thus would not be at all suitable for this usage.

It might not be right thing to do in all situations, but I think it would be useful to at least define one mechanism to do something like that (perhaps even encoding the claims directly in the JWT root). A verifier('s policy) only expects a JWT with some claims; it might not care if they are encoded directly or selectively disclosed from a hash based encoding (or derived from another claim in more advanced systems). Surfacing the calculated claims in the JWT offers the ability for libraries to perform this transformation, and leaving the RP's business logic close to intact.",

      "body": "I would like to propose a very simple and easy-to-implement approach to blinding claim names.\r\n\r\nThe idea is to add a new, optional, third element to the SD releases. Let's assume that there is a privacy-sensitive claims, that might show up in the SD-JWT, say `secret_club_membership_number`, and its mere existence should not be revealed to verifiers.\r\n\r\nThe issuer could create an SD-JWT as follows:\r\n\r\n```json\r\n{\r\n  \"iss\": \"https://example.com/issuer\",\r\n  \"iat\": 1516239022,\r\n  \"exp\": 1516247022,\r\n  \"sd_digests\": {\r\n    \"sub\": \"LbnhkOr5oS7KjeUrxezAu8TG0CpWz0jSixy6tffuo04\",\r\n    \"given_name\": \"fUMdn88aaoyKTHrvZd6AuLmPraGhPJ0zF5r_JhxCVZs\",\r\n    \"family_name\": \"9h5vgv6TpFV6GmnPtugiMLl5tHetHeb5X_2cKHjN7cw\",\r\n    \"G1fjh8hpWNnb\": \"Ia1Tc6_Xnt5CJc2LtKcu6Wvqr42glBGGcjGOye8Zf3U\"\r\n  },\r\n  \"hash_alg\": \"sha-256\"\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe issuer has replaced the claim name `secret_club_membership_number` with an arbitrary string. \r\n\r\nOnly the SVC (and later the SD-JWT-R) would release the claim name:\r\n\r\n```json\r\n{\r\n  \"sd_release\": {\r\n    \"sub\": \"[\\\"eluV5Og3gSNII8EYnsxA_A\\\", \\\"6c5c0a49-b589-431d-bae7-219122a9ec2c\\\"]\",\r\n    \"given_name\": \"[\\\"6Ij7tM-a5iVPGboS5tmvVA\\\", \\\"John\\\"]\",\r\n    \"family_name\": \"[\\\"eI8ZWm9QnKPpNPeNenHdhQ\\\", \\\"Doe\\\"]\",\r\n    \"G1fjh8hpWNnb\": \"[\\\"G02NSrQfjFXQ7Io09syajA\\\", \\\"1940-01-01\\\", \\\"secret_club_membership_number\\\"]\"\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\nNotice the third element in the release JSON. It signals to the verifier that the real claim name is different from how the claim was called in the SD-JWT.\r\n\r\nThe verifier would, during the verification step, replace the claim name `G1fjh8hpWNnb` with the now learned correct claim name `secret_club_membership_number`.\r\n\r\nInstead of random string as claim names, anything that is unique works:\r\n \r\n * just numbering all hidden claims: `secret_claim_1`, `secret_claim_1`,...\r\n * random numbers, string, etc.\r\n * also real-looking but fake claim names: `public_club_membership_number`, `birthdate` (security by obscurity?!)\r\n\r\nThis does not hide the number of secret claim names or that a claim at a certain position in a maybe more complex structure exists. @peppelinux proposal on anonymous claims seems to cover that, but if I understand it correctly, it is less fine-grained: https://github.com/oauthstuff/draft-selective-disclosure-jwt/issues/80\r\n\r\nWDYAT? @b---c @Sakurann ",

I however think that issuers with a well-known public and fixed issuance schema is a far more common scenario, for which our proposed selective disclosure feature offers a simple and useful solution. I can also imagine scenarios as described in this issue, but I'm not sure how realistic/common they are. I'd be in favor of keeping the spec simple, and explore this extra features in subsequent specs or profiles.\r\n\r\nA solution to the hidden claim name (and value!) is to issue multiple credentials containing various subsets of the available claims. It then helps to know how commonly one is expected to hide the existence of such claims to balance the pain of managing multiple credentials vs. holding one with this selective disclosure feature.",

Combined presentation reduces the number of signatures to be created and checked for holder authentication/cryptographic holder binding and also requires the verifier to check audience restriction and transaction integrity once. On the other hand, it requires binding of both (or all) credentials to the same key material. So it seems to be an attractive feature, I cannot assess how relevant it is in practice and whether it causes complexity in other places.  ",

If a label for something is actually a secret, it should be treated as such. That said, I get that this scenario must be addressed. Sensitive predicates or graduated disclosure contexts can benefit from this capability. \r\n\r\nIt seems to me that the most useful and easy algorithm to implement is to use the same hash algorithm + salt for the node value to blind the label where: SALTED LABEL = HASH_ALGO(LABEL + SALT)\r\nOf course, this assumes that specific guidance is included for best practice salt generation (fresh entropy gathering for each attribute block salt, sufficient bits of entropy, etc.) for strong cryptographic outcomes.\r\n```\r\n\"_sd\": {\r\n  \"9-J2445a_p91...\": {\r\n    \"h\": \"Y823Kowek92...\", // b64url\r\n    \"l\": \"name\"\r\n    \"s\": \"H82leq3!4...\", // re-use salt\r\n    \"id\": \"did:jwk:894fa94hg10AOEe82\u2026#0\", //claim specific DID URL binding\r\n    \"v\": \"Slim Shady\"\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\nIn this representation, the salted hash of the label's value (\"name\") \"9-J2445a_p91...\" can be addressed directly by the digest \"h\" value in compact form: \r\n```\r\n\"_sd\": {\r\n  \"9-J2445a_p91...\": \"Y823Kowek92...\"\r\n}\r\n```\r\nSide-note:\r\nInformative statements that recommend large sd-jwt claim sets should be 'broken down' into much smaller sets, or individual claims, then wrapped and sealed as a JWP may be better than including too many claims in an sd-jwt.\r\n\r\n",

Select the placeholder as some function of the original claim name (the label in your proposal) and the salt\r\n\r\nWhat I wanted to express is that I think option 1 is better. From a security perspective, both are equivalent. There is no need to choose the placeholder claim name in a particular way, we just need to ensure that it does not leak information about the original claim name. Just numbering all placeholder claim names would be fine as well (as long as the numbering does not reveal anything, e.g., the position of the original claim in the list of claims.) \r\n\r\nBut for option 2, I see two drawbacks:\r\n\r\n - We need to explain more, in particular how to assemble the input for the function, similar to the discussion we had about the hidden claim values. For example, we need to define how the original claim name and the salt are concatenated such that there can be no prefix collisions. \r\n - A verifier receiving an SD-JWT with blinded claim names according to option 2 may be tempted to (needlessly) check that the claim name was created in a particular way by recalculating the hash. If the issuer has made a mistake when calculating the hash or the verifier makes a mistake, this check will fail. Since such a check is not needed, it would be better if we don't set this trap in the first place.\r\n\r\nI see no advantages of option 2 over option 1, so I propose to go for option 1.",

      "body": "## Problem statement\r\n\r\nCurrently, in sd-jwt spec, the recommended representation for JSON property values is to embed escaped JSON that represents a salted hash of the value. This seems to add complexity, room for error, and superfluous verbosity. Instead, specifying that claims in an \"_sd\" container are themselves ONE OF the following: \r\n(a) simple plain-text values\r\n(b) an object of specified properties supporting blinded property values\r\n(c) an object with specified properties supporting a blinded graph\r\n\r\nThere's a good balance of specificity and flexibility here (IMHO) for implementors to accommodate many different scenarios - as opposed to having to unescape and then detect the contents of an attribute's values. With strict conventions on certain attributes of an attribute block, relying parties are guaranteed some properties right away that can be validated before the actual values are read into memory - increasing reliability, security, and permitting faster failure sequences. In addition, writing unit and functional test automation suites for escaped stringified JSON is problematical at best and prone to some of the same formatting problems of concern with structured JSON values. It can also give way to new inconsistent ordering problems during serialized representation testing.\r\n\r\nHowever, per issue 27 - and other discussions that I could uncover, there is ongoing concern over c18n for hash reproducibility. I completely understand why. What I\u2019m proposing might be radioactive, but in this implementor's opinion, is unburdening: I do not think that it\u2019s the SD-JWT spec\u2019s problem to solve data format representation compatibility across all languages and libraries. Furthermore, I don\u2019t think that SD-JWT spec needs to solve for all extended/intermediate representations of claim values - especially when it comes to VC use-cases. In the spirit of good interface building and abstraction, I propose that it\u2019s possible to think of SD-JWT as foundational for other more opinionated specifications.\r\n\r\nIf statements put in attribute values need interpretation, then I\u2019d suggest other means for doing so like metadata encoding specific sections, SD-JWT issuer documentation, JSON Schema, JCS (as an example: RFC 8785 has guidelines for int64 strict encoding). I humbly warn that normatively specifying that values for properties should be escaped JSON AND that you should stuff other important and specified k<>v  pairs in the escaped JSON - is a mistake and will damage adoption for the spec. I don\u2019t think that taking ownership over the shape of claim values should be part of this spec, especially if the goal of a claim is to be \u201canything you want\u201d\u2026\r\n\r\nBoling down the problem of canonicalizing some value(s) - it seems most important to address bitwise value compatibility issues and the way that serialization libraries might handle non-primitive types (as opposed to distressing about ordering). Perhaps there are ways through this that don\u2019t involve incomplete or burdensome canonicalization libraries. Several libraries responsible for producing consistent hashes over JSON (ie: node.js `object-hash`) internally detect and encode incompatible datatypes. Would it be possible for SD-JWT to specify that prior to salting and hashing the attribute - its value must be: \r\nFully compacted (in the case of a JSON graph)\r\nEncoded using utf-8 octal, base64, base64url, hex, or some other specific encoding scheme\r\nThen salted and hashed?\r\n\r\nOn the whole, escaped stringified JSON values as the basis for SVC should probably be rethought. This issue aims to try and start that conversation with some meaningful solutions\r\n\r\nBy way of examples, you could instead represent SD-JWTs as:\r\n\r\n## blinded attribute block\r\n```\r\n\"_sd\": {\r\n  \"name\": {\r\n    \"h\": \"VGhlIHF1aWNrIGJyb3duIGZveCBqdW1wcyBvdmVyIDEzIGxhenkgZG9ncy4=\", // base64url\r\n    \"s\": \"6YCYrdrSxs7q6dlO562YI6GhAktsBExFe6rcCZ+OX9I=\", // base64url\r\n    \"id\": \"did:jwk:894fa94hg10AOEe82\u2026#0\", //claim specific DID URL binding\r\n    \"v\": \"Slim Shady\"\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\nExample generation:\r\nHash over the compact form node for \"name\", without the \"h\" property present. Encode the resulting digest in base64url encoding. Insert the digest as property \"h\" into the \"name\" attribute block.\r\n\r\nEnables compact blinded presentation form of \r\n{\"name\": \"VGhlIHF1aWNrIGJyb3duIGZveCBqdW1wcyBvdmVyIDEzIGxhenkgZG9ncy4=\"}\r\n\r\nThe underlying salt, which is never revealed unless the \"name\" property value is revealed, disables direct attack on the property - even with the label, type, and validation procedure for the value data of the property is known.\r\n\r\nBy letting JSON be JSON in the entire document structure, you enable an issuer to (optionally) be very specific about the structure of the value entered for an attribute. This further enhances security - especially if the signature (or even simply a hash) of the schema for the SD-JWT is described in the signed-over envelope (in a VC-SD-JWT).\r\n\r\n## blinded, nested eKYC graph\r\n\r\nThe standardized definition of what an eKYC data model is supposed to look like is a bit ambiguous, so I assume what you\u2019re concerned with is something like OIDC...\r\n```\r\n\"_sd\": {\r\n  \"oidc_req\": {\r\n    \"h\": \"...\",\r\n    \"s\": \"...\",\r\n    \"v\": {\r\n      \"scope\": [..., ..., ...],\r\n      \"response_type\": \"code\",\r\n      \"client_id\": \"...\",\r\n      \"redirect_uri\": \"...\",\r\n      \"nonce\": \"...\"\r\n    }\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\nthe \"v\" of the claim is valid, and validatable JSON. The semantic meaning of the outer, securely disclosable, claim name can be either domain-specific or use a JSON-LD context.\r\n",

The use of the escaped JSON in the credential is what allows SD-JWT to support any type, including objects, for property values. Ideally, anything that builds on top of SD-JWT will not need to handle the escaped JSON format, as (for example) the verification algorithm outputs a JSON without any JSON escaped values for further processing by the application. I'm therefore not convinced that the \"unusual\" format for property values in the credential is a problem.\r\n\r\nThat said, the escaped JSON is not a great solution and raises a lot of eyebrows. But we think that it is the best solution we have. It is trivially easy to implement correctly, using any JSON library out there. The issue we're addressing is not solvable by prescribing a certain JSON schema (as it works on a higher layer). JCS would solve the problem, but increase implementation complexity. Even just compacting objects, as proposed below, is a relatively complex operation requiring a full JSON parser.\r\n",

The encoding methodology employed here is similar to what some standards already employ and seems to be normatively used in JPT. \r\n\r\nFirst for a property value that we want to blind (let's use some arbitrary JSON): \r\n```\r\n{\r\n  \"array\": [\r\n    1,\r\n    2,\r\n    3\r\n  ],\r\n  \"boolean\": true,\r\n  \"color\": \"gold\",\r\n  \"null\": null,\r\n  \"number\": 123,\r\n  \"object\": {\r\n    \"a\": \"b\",\r\n    \"c\": \"d\"\r\n  },\r\n  \"string\": \"Hello World\"\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nMust first be in compact form (normatively): \r\n```\r\n{\"array\":[1,2,3],\"boolean\":true,\"color\":\"gold\",\"null\":null,\"number\":123,\"object\":{\"a\":\"b\",\"c\":\"d\"},\"string\":\"Hello World\"}\r\n```\r\n\r\nNext, using a natively available json library function, or an easily supported polyfill - uint8array the value: \r\n```\r\nlet uc1 = '{\"array\":[1,2,3],\"boolean\":true,\"color\":\"gold\",\"null\":null,\"number\":123,\"object\":{\"a\":\"b\",\"c\":\"d\"},\"string\":\"Hello World\"}';\r\nlet encoder = new TextEncoder();\r\nlet uc1Uint8Array = encoder.encode(uc1);\r\nconsole.log(\"uc1: \", uc1Uint8Array.toString());\r\n//\"uc1: \", \"123,34,97,114,114,97,121,34,58,91,49,44,50,44,51,93,44,34,98,111,111,108,101,97,110,34,58,116,114,117,101,44,34,99,111,108,111,114,34,58,34,103,111,108,100,34,44,34,110,117,108,108,34,58,110,117,108,108,44,34,110,117,109,98,101,114,34,58,49,50,51,44,34,111,98,106,101,99,116,34,58,123,34,97,34,58,34,98,34,44,34,99,34,58,34,100,34,125,44,34,115,116,114,105,110,103,34,58,34,72,101,108,108,111,32,87,111,114,108,100,34,125\"\r\n```\r\n\r\nNow, it's possible to go in a number of directions in the representation... the uint8array string is quite simple and leaves little room for misinterpretation by an application during reproduction.\r\nUsing the hashing algorithm specified in the security envelope, salt & hash the string to get your digest.

But I *think* that simplifying to just the hashes might be the way to go.\r\n\r\n- Where does the HMAC key come from? The salt value that would conceptually/presumably be the HMAC key is part of the string literal value that the digest is computed over, which is awkward. But also not explicitly defined. So it's an exercise left up to the reader, which isn't great for interoperability. \r\n- The JOSE alg registry doesn't seem appropriate for the HMAC algs in this different context. And isn't sufficient (see point above) for interoperability.\r\n- Allowing the value to come from two different unrelated registries or \"another specification and/or profile of this specification\" without a registry seems problematic on a number of fronts \r\n- The name `sd_digest_derivation_alg` is longer than typical JWT names (sha 256 could also potentially be a default if the thing isn't present to make things smaller in the common MTI case) \r\n- digest derivation function doesn't seem like a commonly used term\r\n- seems like the alg indicator could/should go under the `sd_digests` rather than being an independent claim at the same level (unless `sd_digests` goes away, which I'm starting to think it should based on conversations with Dr. @danielfett on Tues, in which case this point is moot) \r\n",

There needs to be a separator different from the ones in the JWT itself for distinguishing the JWT from the \"attachment\". So these two would work in that mental model:\r\n`<SD-JWT>~<Disclosure 1>~<Disclosure 2>~...~<Disclosure N>`\r\nor\r\n`<SD-JWT>~<Disclosure 1>.<Disclosure 2>.<...>.<Disclosure N>`\r\n\r\nI assume that your and the devs' mental model is that the whole thing that is being sent is a special form of JWT that consists of four instead of three parts:\r\n`<Header>.<Payload>.<Signature>.<Attachment>` where the Attachment is the `~`-separated Disclosures.\r\n\r\nThat would mean, however, that the whole Combined Format is a special kind of JWT with four parts. I don't see it that way. The Combined Format is just a means of sending a JWT and some extra data. ",

JAdES signatures need JSON Serialization for the most signature levels: B-T, B-LT, B-LTA. \r\n\r\nI agree with @Sakurann and would prefer not to embed the disclosures in the SD-JWT JSON object. My additional arguments:\r\n\r\n- If the disclosures are contained in the same object as the SD-JWT, the user is more likely to forget to extract the disclosures before the presentation, which would result in a full disclosure. The first part of the issuance Combined Format should be passed untouched in the first part of the pressentation Combined Format.\r\n- The first part of the Combined Format should be a well-formed JWT or JSON-Encoded JWS which can be directly validated without removing parts of the JSON Object.\r\n\r\nI have two related questions:\r\nShould the JSON serialized SD-JWT be base64url encoded in the Combined Formats to avoid `~` or other special characters in the SD-JWT part? This would mean:\r\n\r\n`base64url(SD-JWT in JSON Serialization)~Disclosures~HolderBindingJWT`\r\n\r\nHow to distinguish between the two serializations on the holder and verifier side?

Do we need two different types?\r\n\r\nyeah, I had the same question... I think realistically, based on the trust framework/interoperability profile, holder/verifier will know which serialization to expect. otherwise, holder/verifier needs to check every time after b64url decoding an SD-JWT part for the serialization, based on things like the presence of a JWS header..",

For example, a holder would need to know to disclose the name whenever disclosing a subordinate so would have to keep track of a lot more in terms of the Disclosures and the relationship between some of them. A verifier would need to deal with disclosed claims under an undisclosed name. The approach would need to say whether clear text claims would be allowed under a blinded name/key. And there too, what would it mean to a verifier to get claims where a key name is blinded but has clear data under it. \r\n\r\nAlso I'm not sure it's acceptable to use the digest value directly as the key value. Thus far we've tried to clearly differentiate the blinded parts with the \"_sd\" array claim. And in other design discussions we've avoided use of the hash value directly in place of where the actual value would be. \r\n\r\nOn one level it is quite simple. But it's deceptively so.

Since there is no cryptographically secure RNG of the operating system, it is possible to analyze the decoys to determine entropy / detect patterns, thereby undermining security. but hashing the RNG output just makes this process a lot slower. It simply adds computational overhead to any attempt to brute force it. \r\n\r\nIt seems to that the text simply \"inherited\" the security best practice from generating sensitive material like tokens. In the context of decoys the risks are perhaps not that great, but it is not like adding a SHA256 step results in any performance hit",

I don't understand the proposed flow between issuer, holder, and verifier; perhaps a data flow section would help. I would think the holder gets a 3+1 part JWS with SVC (which can be `.`-concatenated). Then all you need to present to a verifier is the same data, along with some user proof key signature if the JWT is bound to a user key (for which a property is added in the SD-JWT-R, if I understood correctly; more details would be helpful here).\r\n",

Consider just a bit more about what a SD-JWT-R is/does. Borrowing from https://www.ietf.org/archive/id/draft-fett-oauth-selective-disclosure-jwt-00.html#name-sd-jwt-release-sd-jwt-r maybe \"This document also defines a format for so-called SD-JWT Releases (SD-JWT-R), which conveys a subset of the claim values of an SD-JWT in a verifiable way\" or something along those lines.  Honestly, after reading the doc a few times, I'm unsure whether a SD-JWT-R is the encoded SVC or SD-JWT and SVC Combined Format. Or both. Or something else. And is it for releasing to the holder or the verifier or both? I think there's room for the various terms to be tightened up and clarified. And also in how they are used.",

The verifier may learn just from the presence of any restrictions that the owner of the license may not be of best health, potentially using it to their disadvantage.\r\n\r\nAlways including claims and just nulling the value when not applicable can prevent this.",

With more examples (W3C VC) and more example code (claims merging) to come, things will get more complicated.\r\n\r\nI therefore moved the examples into a separate directory as YAML files. I used YAML, because this means that we can store all data required for each example as separate JSON documents in one YAML file (JSON is a subset of YAML). \r\n\r\nThe code can now be called with a YAML file as the input and will run the demo for the example defined in the file. This will make it easier for us to add more examples in the future.\r\n\r\nAlso in this pull request:\r\n\r\n- Cleaned up the code to produce just one example each time - there is no need to calculate all examples when only one is used in each run\r\n- Cleaned up the code to produce both the CLI output and the spec examples from the same set of data to avoid repetitions\r\n- This means that placeholders in main.md are now strictly named as follows: `example-{example_id}-{artifact_id}`, where `artifact_id` refers to the identifier of the data produced in the example run (see `sd_jwt` file).\r\n- Fix for example output: serialized SVC was not shown, but serialized SD-JWT twice\r\n- Renamed `_sel_exp` to `_artifacts` (not sure what `_sel_exp` was meant to say)\r\n- Fix for no_randomness: RNG was seeded to static value even when no_randomness was not used",

It actually gives the impression that linkability is unavoidable if this RFC is implemented, since for a solution it only refers to undefined \u2018advanced cryptographic schemes outside the scope of this specification\u2019. However, in reality an issuer can completely avoid linkability on the basis of unique values encoded in the SD-JWT, simply by ensuring that each SD-JWT can be used for only one transaction. Of course, this places stringent demands on the connectivity of the holder app and the capacity of the issuer\u2019s systems for generating and communicating new SD-JWTs to its holder apps. To lessen these burdens, the issuer could also choose other approaches, for example \r\n> - Equipping each holder app with a pool of (for instance) 20 different SD-JWTs. The app would then randomly pick one of these SD-JWTs for every transaction, and re-start the pool once all JWTs have been used. \r\n> - Allowing each SD-JWT to be used multiple times, but only for a limited time.\r\n> \r\n> The SD-JWT mechanism therefore allows every issuer to find the correct balance between holder linkability and mitigation costs and efforts, based on a risk analysis for their specific situation.\r\nPlease re-write section 8.2 in the light of the above suggestions.\r\n",

Such a spec/profile would need to define that hash function for use at the SD-JWT layer as a single input to single digest output thing. But it could map/profile something like PBKDF2 to do that or define a 30 billion iteration sha2 thing. \r\n\r\nI'm not sure how much of that we want to say here.
